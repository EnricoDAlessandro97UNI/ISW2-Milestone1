and storage container grpc proxy\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis is a subsequent change after apache/bookkeeper#1428.\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrent almost every grpc requests are wrapped into `StorageContainerRequest` and their responses\nare wrapped into `StorageContainerResponse`. It makes things a bit complicated on adding new grpc\nservices.\n\n*Changes*\n\nTo simplify things, this PR introduces two functionalities for simplifying dispatching container requests/responses.\n\n1) *StorageContainerClientInterceptor*: A grpc `ClientInterceptor` that stamps container information (currently is `scId`) into the requests' metadata before sending the requests to the wire.\n\n2) A simple grpc reverse proxy to dispatch grpc requests to the channels provided by a `ChannelFinder`.\n\n*Tests*\n\n1. Existing unit tests covered client interceptor changes.\n2. Introduced a `stream-storage-tests-common` module to include common classes that would be used for testing.\n3. Introduced a `PingPongService` for testing reverse proxy : unary/client-streaming/server-streaming/bidi-streaming.\n\nMaster Issue: #1205\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1430 from sijie/interceptor_container_requests","tree":{"sha":"7c77be2cf0166f50ceaa889e000dbb7437ed9be1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/7c77be2cf0166f50ceaa889e000dbb7437ed9be1"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4"}]},{"sha":"6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjZiZmFkMDhiNDg1MTQwNmMyMTljMWI1ZGM0NDVjMzM0NTNlN2VjYzQ=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-25T07:58:26Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-25T07:58:26Z"},"message":"Issue #1434: Checkstyle is not executed at some modules\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCheckstyle was supposed to run at `validate` phase for every modules.

It makes things a bit complicated on adding new grpc\nservices.\n\nTo simplify things, we can use grpc ClientInterceptor to stamp container information (e.g. scId)\ninto the request metadata and write a grpc service registry to take the container information from\nrequest metadata and dispatch requests to containers.\n\nIn order to achieve it, we need to move the grpc services to storage container.\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis PR moves grpc services from server module to storage module, so we can simplify the wire protocols.\n\nMaster Issue: #1205\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1428 from sijie/move_grpc_service_to_storage","tree":{"sha":"069b5f88acce48d2b74c6f9ab643eaec495d71bf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/069b5f88acce48d2b74c6f9ab643eaec495d71bf"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/ea0b90cd9971b99be17b4e1ae9dbcd66c630daa6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ea0b90cd9971b99be17b4e1ae9dbcd66c630daa6","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/ea0b90cd9971b99be17b4e1ae9dbcd66c630daa6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ea0b90cd9971b99be17b4e1ae9dbcd66c630daa6/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"b0b69a337b4220752dfb512fdb99cfc5bdab564a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/b0b69a337b4220752dfb512fdb99cfc5bdab564a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/b0b69a337b4220752dfb512fdb99cfc5bdab564a"}]},{"sha":"b0b69a337b4220752dfb512fdb99cfc5bdab564a","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmIwYjY5YTMzN2I0MjIwNzUyZGZiNTEyZmRiOTljZmM1YmRhYjU2NGE=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-23T17:56:04Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-23T17:56:04Z"},"message":"Publish bookkeeper dev image to docker hub\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nWe built a `bookkeeper-current` image that reflects latest master for integration tests.

Most significant tests will come with the force() API, at this point we can only test that we have not broken the LAC advance mechanism.\n\nAuthor: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV)\n\nThis closes #853 from eolivelli/bp14-deferred-force-write-client-side","tree":{"sha":"38b87871d822dfb77dbd2512235128786ea8897f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/38b87871d822dfb77dbd2512235128786ea8897f"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/9655943e6be5ac86060134c16ec24d6f0c822f56","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9655943e6be5ac86060134c16ec24d6f0c822f56","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9655943e6be5ac86060134c16ec24d6f0c822f56","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9655943e6be5ac86060134c16ec24d6f0c822f56/comments","author":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"c8bcecc3fb38932a2e6444d5362ad1d82ee630af","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/c8bcecc3fb38932a2e6444d5362ad1d82ee630af","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/c8bcecc3fb38932a2e6444d5362ad1d82ee630af"}]},{"sha":"c8bcecc3fb38932a2e6444d5362ad1d82ee630af","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmM4YmNlY2MzZmIzODkzMmEyZTY0NDRkNTM2MmFkMWQ4MmVlNjMwYWY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-22T08:43:46Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-22T08:43:46Z"},"message":"Allow bookie to start if failed to load extra server components\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\n`extraServerComponents` provides the flexibility to allow bookie to start with extra server components.\nIt acts as a plugin mechanism to extend the functionality of bookies.

However the scripts and configurations for dlog and table-service modules are still in their own modules. It is inconvenient and confusing. This change mainly refactor current bookkeeper script to make it reusable for other modules.\n\n*Code Change*\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n- abstract the common logic in `bin/bookkeeper` to `bin/common.sh`. These common logics include:\n   * common definitions on environment variables, such jvm settings, bk conf, log4j conf, classpath and such.\n   * common functions can be reusable, such as find jars, add maven dependencies.\n- simplify `bin/bookkeeper` and `bin/bookkeeper-cli` by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n- remove `stream/distributedlog/core/bin/dlog` to `bin/dlog` and simplify it by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n\n*Tests*\n\nMost of the changes in this PR are tests to ensure this script refactor is done correctly.\n\n- introduced a module `tests/scripts` for testing all the bash scripts in bookkeeper project. This module uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) for testing bash scripts. This gives a good test coverage on `bin/common.sh`.\n\n- add a few CLI smoketests under `tests/integration/smoke` to smoke test all CLI tools, including `bin/bookkeeper shell`, `bin/bookkeeper-cli` and `bin/dlog`. This makes sure all the CLI scripts work well after refactor.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1407 from sijie/include_dlog_library","tree":{"sha":"aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312"}]},{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjkyNTkxNzMzYzhiNzc4ZjYzY2Q3MWEwMGIyYzdlZDJjNjljNDEzMTI=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1403: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown on readLastAddConfirmedAndEntry\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThere are two bugs in `ReadLastAddConfirmedAndEntry`:\n\n1) a regression was introduced by #657. the long poll read op is attempting to long-poll reading lac. since lac is stored across ensemble, so the retry logic assumes it will attempt over all the bookies in the ensemble. however #657 use a `write-quorum-size` write set for tracking those attempts. this leads to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException reported at #1403. The integrate tests added in this PR can easily reproduce this issue.\n\n2) there was a bug on retry logic when a ledger whose ensemble size is larger than write quorum size. when this happens, it will claim lac is not advanced prior to attempt the bookie in the ensemble. so the client will never know lac is advanced if using long poll reads on such ledgers. The integrate tests added in this PR can also catch this issue.\n\ndisclaim: twitter uses long poll reads but never uses `ensembleSize > writeQuorumSize`. so this is not a problem for dlog users.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- introduce a `getWriteSetForLongPoll` call that uses `ensembleSize` for building the write set. this would address problem 1)\n- fix the assignment of `numEmptyResponsesAllowed`, so the long poll reads can work with `ensembleSize > writeQuorumSize`\n- add integration tests for long polling reads\n\nat the same time, also add an integration test for

http server\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrently metrics provider and http admin endpoint are isolated due to the way how things are modularized.\nThis requires two ports to be used, one is for metrics provider to expose metrics, while the other one is used by\nhttp admin endpoint for expose admin endpoints.\n\nWhen implementing a bookkeeper operator on k8s, it becomes confusing on managing those ports and do health checks.\nIt would be good to allow export metrics in same http admin endpoint if it is enabled.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- Introduce a method `writeAllMetrics` in stats provider to allow stats provider exporting metrics.\n- Add a `MetricsService` in bookie http service and export stats provider's metrics under `/metrics` endpoint.\n\nThis

The helix controller's placement is kind of not assuming any properties of shared storage. however the table service is leverage bookkeeper's as its segment/log store. the table service is built in a more `stateless` way, where a storage container can be moved between servers in a much lightweight way.\n\nAlso helix codebase is a bit large, if we eventually going to eliminate zookeeper, the cost of switching it off helix will be much expensive. so this PR is introducing a simple zk based controller for assigning storage containers to servers.\n\n*Solution*\n\nIn this zk base solution, it is comprised of 3 parts: server registration, cluster & storage controller, storage container manager.\n\n**registration**\n\nthis solution leverages existing registration client/manager interfaces. so each storage server registers itself under `/stream/servers/available`.\n\n**cluster & storage controller**\n\nA storage server is elected as a the leader, which runs a ClusterController. The cluster controller reads cluster metadata from zookeeper (the cluster metadata includes like how many containers available in the cluster), and use a storage controller to compute an assignment plan as the ideal state for container assignment mapping, and then update the assignment mapping to zookeeper under `/stream/assignment`.\n\n**storage container manager**\n\nEach storage server runs a storage container manager, which watches the assignment plan in zookeeper. The cluster controller updates the assignment plan. Once it receives watches/updates from the assignment plan that computed by cluster controller, the storage container manager will align itself to the ideal assignment map by starting/stopping storage containers.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1392 from

Most of the classes can actually be reused for use cases that have similar service discovery and writable/readonly state transition management.\n\n*Solution*\n\nThe change is try to cleanup `BookieStateManager` and `ZKRegistrationManager` to make them more generic and can be reused for other usage.\n\n*Result*\n\nRegistration Interfaces and StateManager can be used outside of bookie.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1373 from sijie/refactor_bookie_state_manager","tree":{"sha":"fe31d140c16317d66daae1e73c15d58ec5a652cd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/fe31d140c16317d66daae1e73c15d58ec5a652cd"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/acb4e653428f38337af94bcb829956b44e39312d","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/acb4e653428f38337af94bcb829956b44e39312d","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/acb4e653428f38337af94bcb829956b44e39312d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/acb4e653428f38337af94bcb829956b44e39312d/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9134401954e860021a1a7314c55861eca0481ae6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9134401954e860021a1a7314c55861eca0481ae6","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9134401954e860021a1a7314c55861eca0481ae6"}]},{"sha":"9134401954e860021a1a7314c55861eca0481ae6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjkxMzQ0MDE5NTRlODYwMDIxYTFhNzMxNGM1NTg2MWVjYTA0ODFhZTY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-04T02:08:35Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-04T02:08:35Z"},"message":"[TABLE SERVICE] [DLOG] Fix `ConcurrentModificationException` on accessing component configuration\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motiviation*\n\nCurrently when running table service in standalone mode, it occasionally throws `ConcurrentModificationException`.

This new \"FastCodahaleMetricsProvider\" brings a new timer implementation \"FastTimer\", which extends Codahale's Timer class, provides an identical API, is registered in Codahale's timer registry, and can be queried through the existing JettyServices implementation. FastTimer provides similar functionality as Codahale's default timer, but is significantly faster and (nearly) garbage free.\n\nThe improvements of FastTimer over Codahale default Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs are:\n* entirely garbage-free Timer updates (only snapshot creations when querying a timer allocate a small number of Java objects)\n* 3x faster Timer updates (i.e. 3x shorter code-path to update a timer)\n* half the memory footprint (in default configuration)\n\nFastTimer reduces GC pause times in our experiments as described in Issue 1363 by half (same as entirely deactivating all timers).\n\nThe primary functional differences between FastTimer and Codahale default Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs are:\n* FastTimer keeps values for a fixed, configurable time period (default: 60 seconds) rather than exponentially decaying them\n* FastTimer bucketizes event times rather than storing discrete values. Percentile values depend on the bucket resolution.\n\nDesign Considerations\n---------------------\n\nThe design goals of this timer implementation are for it to be\n - fast (i.e. few instructions to update a timer)\n - scalable (i.e. little synchronization cost for concurrent timer updates)\n - garbage-free for timer updates (i.e. no object allocation for timer updates)\n - space-efficient (i.e. as little memory footprint as possible while achieving first three goals)\n - provide similar functionality as Codahale's default timers with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs\n\nThis implementation provides rate and response times over a configurable sliding time window. Data\nis stored in upfront allocated circular arrays, in which each array element holds data\nfor one second. Data is overwritten in a circular fashion without the allocation of new data\nstructures and is therefore garbage-free for all timer updates.\n\nThis implementation does not store individual response times, but instead allocates bucketized counters\nupfront, which are incremented for any event falling into a particular response time bucket. A\nfine-grained bucket definition (intended for capturing successsful events) and a coarse-grained\nbucket definition (intended to capture failure or timed-out events) are provided.\n\nTo improve scalability of concurrent timer updates, most data structures are replicated HASH_SIZE\ntimes, and calling threads updating a timer are hashed to individual instances. Performance tests\n(see below) have shown that this implementation is light-weight enough to achieve slightly better\nscalability than Codahale's default timers even without hashing, and can further improve scalability\nif hashing is used.\n\nTrading off performance and scalability vs. memory footprint, we need to be conservative in the hash\nsize we chose. Different flavors of this timer implementation have been evaluated using JMH\nmicro-benchmarks (see microbenchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/stats/TimerBenchmark.java),\ncomparing implementations of FastTimer with a time window of 60 seconds and\n- (DEV1)   a HASH_SIZE of 3 for all data structures (meters, counters, min/max, and response time buckets)\n- (DEV2)   a HASH_SIZE of 1 for all data structures (meters, counters, min/max, and response time buckets)\n- (FINAL)  a HASH_SIZE of 3 for meters, counters, min/max, and no hashing for response time buckets\nto the default timer implementation\n- (BASE-E) Codahale Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoir (default as used by bookkeeper code)\n- (BASE-T) Codahale Timer with SlidingTimeWindowReservoir configured to 60 seconds\n- (BASE-S) Codahale Timer with SlidingWindowReservoir configured to hold 100,000 events.\n\nBased on results below, implementation (FINAL) was chosen as the final FastTimer implementation, as it\nachieves nearly the same throughput as (DEV1) at nearly the same memory footprint as (DEV2), and\nultimately achieves roughly 3x higher throughput and scalability that Codahale's default implementation\nat around half the memory footprint.\n\nThe following results have been collected on an eight core x86 server running at 3.2 GHz (updated\ntimers are shared across 4 threads):\n\n```\nConfig   Timer Impl             Timers   Threads      ops/ms   Alloc B/op   Kb/TimerPair\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

instantiate a\nCodahale MetricsServlet, which instantiates a Codahale MetricsModule, which only serializes\ntimers that are instances of Timer class into the json output stream). Unless we wanted to\nreimplement or override all these base classes, we can't just implement Codahale's Metered and Sampling\ninterfaces. Instead we have to extend its Timer class, even though we're not using any of its\ninherited functionality or data structures. The inherited (unused) member variables of Codahale Timer\nconsume slightly less than 512 byte per FastTimer (measured around 425 byte in Codahale 3.1).\nAbove memory footprint results include ~ 1 kb of inherited (unused) data structures, which comprise\naround 1% of FastTimer's overall memory footprint.\n\nIn terms of functionality, FastTimer provides the same functionality as Codahale's timers\n(in default configuration with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs), with the following exceptions:\n- Statistics are kept for a fixed amount of time (rather than exponentially decayed), by\n  default 60 seconds.

So far, we haven't yet allocated or copied any new buffers. But in order to send the buffer to the bookies, PendingAddOp.safeRun() will invoke sendWriteRequest() for each bookie in the write set, which will eventually invoke PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() for each bookie. In here, we are now allocating two new byte[] and copying the buffer twice per bookie for V3 protocol with protobuf:\n    byte[] toSendArray = toSend.toArray();      // 1st byte[] allocation and copy\n    .setBody(ByteString.copyFrom(toSendArray)); // 2nd byte[] allocation and copy\nIf for example we're using a write set size of 3, then we allocate 6 byte arrays and copy the same buffer 6 times.\n\nAll 6 copies can be eliminated if DigestManager.computeDigestAndPackageForSending() would return a ByteBuf (or ByteBufList) that is backed by an array, which we can access and use without further copying it. PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() could then wrap this array into a protobuf ByteString without performing any additional copies.\n\nThis change eliminates all byte[] allocations and copies in PCBC by:\n1. allocating a new (pooled) array-backed heap ByteBuf for header, digest, and data in DigestManager.computeDigestAndPackageForSending()\n2. copying the data payload into this newly allocated ByteBuf and returning it wrapped into a ByteBufList of size 1 (instead of header + body separately)\n3. enhancing ByteBufList to give access to the underlying array if it consists of only a single ByteBuf that's backed by an array\n4. extracting the underlying array in PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() from ByteBufList and wrapping it into protobuf ByteString without copying it.\n\nWith this change, no more object allocations are required in this code path. DigestManager uses a pooled array (1). We're adding one arraycopy in (2) compared to the original code path, trading this against the allocations and copies we save later on.. Later steps, in particular step (4), is free of object allocation and array copies.\nAs a result, the object allocation rate in the AddEntry code path is reduced significantly. In case of a write set size of 3, it is reduced from 6 to 0. This translates into much less frequent young generation garbage collections (in my experiments with write-heavy workload by ~4x overall).\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Michael

However most of the tests and tools are still assuming `zkServers`.\nThis causes a problem if people configures `metadataServiceUri`, some of the admin tools don't actually work.\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis change changes bookkeeper to use `metadataServiceUri` in all the possible places and provides methods to resolve zkServers\nand zkLedgersRootPath from metadata service uri. This ensures:\n\n1) if users configure `metadataServiceUri`, all the tools would work properly.\n2) if users doesn't configure `metadataServiceUri` and still use `zkServers` and `zkLedgersRootPath`, all the tools would still work.\n\n*Changes*\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n- deprecated direct usage of `getZkServers`, `setZkServers`, `getZkLedgersRootPath`, `setZkLedgersRootPath, `getZkAvailablePath` at AbstractConfiguration\n- provide util methods `resolveZkServers` and `resolverZkLedgersRootPath` in `ZkMetadataDriverBase` for resolving zookeeper specific settings from metadata service uri\n- change the tools to use `getMetadataServiceUri`\n- change the tests to use `getMetadataServiceUri` to ensure code coverage\n\n*NOTES*\n\nThere are a few places still using

If the network topology script is not configured, the DNS resolver will return `null` as network location.

DbLedgerStorage\n\nIn normal conditions, the max throughput that a bookie can sustain is mostly determined by how fast we can write entries on the journal.\n\nIf we assume a *very* fast journal, for example using multiple journal threads and setting `journalSyncData=false` or with the journal on a RAM disk (there are some cases in which it might make sense), then the LedgerStorage becomes the \"bottleneck\". We need to be able to flush data on disk faster than the incoming rate, otherwise the write cache will get full and then we have to apply backpressure.\n\nIn different testing scenario, the bottleneck has become the LedgerStoarge flush/checkpoint because it's done by a single thread.\n\nFor smaller entries (1KB) the limit is ~250 K write/s and the limitation is due to preparing a batch with the offsets to write into rocksdb. Each insertion in the batch needs to cross JNI boundaries and that is expensive.\n\nFor bigger entries (10KB), the limit is ~50K write/s (or 500MB /s). This mostly because the single flush thread cannot drive 100% IO utilization on the disks (since it's doing the rest of work). Raw disk writes in that test environment (12 HDDs) could reach 1.4GB/s.\n\nThis change is only relative to DbLedgerStorage and it's a simple refactoring that, when configured with multiple directories, it will hash a ledger into a certain directory. Each directory is flushed independently on its own thread.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1289 from merlimat/db-storage-multiple-dirs","tree":{"sha":"65cc36770b9709cebb63029a98c30270bf83a1e4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/65cc36770b9709cebb63029a98c30270bf83a1e4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0"}]},{"sha":"ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmVhMWE3NWMwNjIyYTkzYWJiZDE2ZmQ3MTgyMGYzYzBjYjVmYzNhYjA=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T23:39:28Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T23:39:28Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1316: A bookie with non-writable dirs should be able to start in readonly mode\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Problem*\n\nBookie failed to start when it doesn't have non-writable dirs.

This setting is replacing `getIsForceGCAllowWhenNoSpace` for creating new log, since entry log files are created not only for gc/compaction. It can also happen on startup and also journal replays.\n\n- Defer creating entry log files until first write happens, when there is no writable ledger dirs.\n\n- add bunch of tests for EntryLog and Bookie initialization.\n\nMaster Issue: #1316\nRelated Issue: #190\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Charan Reddy Guttapalem <reddycharan18@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1319 from sijie/allow_bookie_to_start_with_no_writable_bookies, closes #1316","tree":{"sha":"085a1cb911353faa5725df37c516db1675cab093","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/085a1cb911353faa5725df37c516db1675cab093"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a"}]},{"sha":"956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2Ojk1NmIzN2RhZDc1YTk4YjIzY2ZmMzRlOGNmZTAxNzllMTVlNmQ5OGE=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T18:57:48Z"},"committer":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T18:57:48Z"},"message":"Avoid contention on netty channel promise\n\nWith profiler, I have seen there can be heavy contention between BK threads and Netty IO thread due the the checking for channel write condition that was recently added for monitoring purpose.\n\nThe problem relies in that there is one BK thread that is doing the `writeAndFlush()` on the PCBC and getting the `ChannelFuture`, adding a listener to the future.\n\nThe write operation, though, is completed in the Netty IO thread and the promise gets also triggered from that thread. So, there is contention between current thread adding the listener and the IO threads completing the promise.\n\nIf we add the listener before doing the write on channel, we can avoid the contention. Another option could be to do the write from the Netty IO thread as well.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1321 from merlimat/channel-promise-contention","tree":{"sha":"84ff3d1621c0f72077bf4a67ee897b00cb32a7e5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/84ff3d1621c0f72077bf4a67ee897b00cb32a7e5"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/956b37dad75a98b23cff34e8cfe0179e15e6d98a/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"e6a3aa7e488b87a6d0d08c5bae8564a944815ad7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/e6a3aa7e488b87a6d0d08c5bae8564a944815ad7","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/e6a3aa7e488b87a6d0d08c5bae8564a944815ad7"}]},{"sha":"e6a3aa7e488b87a6d0d08c5bae8564a944815ad7","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmU2YTNhYTdlNDg4Yjg3YTZkMGQwOGM1YmFlODU2NGE5NDQ4MTVhZDc=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-04-05T21:40:55Z"},"committer":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-04-05T21:40:55Z"},"message":"y\n\nPreviously it was not duplicating, so the underlying ByteBuf was being\nreturned to the client, and this was having its reader index modified,\nwhich meant that if it was read again, the data could not be read.\n\nBy calling duplicate() on the LedgerEntryImpl, the underlying ByteBuf\nis sliced and retained, so it has a new set of indices.

OrderedSafeExecutor and OrderedScheduler\n\nAs outlined in https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/102383ea42f473f36720637e41af0ee83fc38d9f992736e0d1a7f985%3Cdev.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E\n\nright now `OrderedSafeExecutor` is implemented on top of `OrderedScheduler`.  There are few problems with this approach that are causing impact on performance:\n\n 1. `OrderedScheduler` is a `ScheduledExecutorService` which uses a priority queue for tasks. The priority queue has a single mutex for both publishers/consumers on the queue\n 2. There are many objects created for each task submission, due to listenable future decorators\n\nSince in all cases in critical write/read path we don't need delay task execution or futures, we should try to have a light weight execution for that.\n\n### Modifications\n\n * Inverted the hierarchy between `OrderedSafeExecutor` and `OrderedScheduler`. Now the base class is `OrderedSafeExecutor` and the other extends from it, since it provides additional methods.\n * Moved `OrderedSafeExecutor` in `bookkeeper-common` since `OrderedScheduler` was already there.\n * Moved `OrderedSafeGenericCallback` in its own file, since it needs to be in `bookkeeper-server` module at this point.\n * Changed some method names from `submitOrdered()` into `executeOrdered()` to be consistent with JDK name (`submit()` returns a future while `execute()` returns void).\n * Changed `BookKeeper` instance of `scheduler` into `OrderedScheduler` so that the few cases which were using the `mainWorkerPool` could be easily converted to use the scheduler instead.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Andrey Yegorov <None>, Enrico Olivelli
