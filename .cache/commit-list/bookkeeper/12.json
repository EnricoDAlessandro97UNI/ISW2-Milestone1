Multiple threads can be be in read mode in the critical section, though they have contention when they're entering/exiting the section.\n\nAdditionally, the Java implementation of read/write lock is creating and destroying a lot of objects when that contention happens.\n\nMy understanding of the code is that we don't need to acquire the read lock in that point. The reason is that, we are already acquiring the lock in the `lookupClient()` method, although only if the pool is null. Additionally, when `Bookkeeper.close()` is invoked all PCBC will be set to closed as well, so it will not be possibile to create a new connection.\n\nAll the line changes in the patch are just removing the readLock acquire and try/finally, and reducing the indentation level.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1292 from merlimat/bookie-client-rw-lock and squashes the following commits:\n\n2104a3aa7 [Matteo Merli] Converted anonymous classes into lambdas\ncabad14e5 [Matteo Merli] Avoid acquiring closeLock.readLock() on every add/read operation","tree":{"sha":"a40ef6bac4d902ea0d08b1976477bb57a125f371","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/a40ef6bac4d902ea0d08b1976477bb57a125f371"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2"}]},{"sha":"d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmQ4Yzk1ODg1MTM2YjQ2MDEzYWU5NDJiM2QzMmFlMGVhNjY4NjZkZDI=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-03-29T13:17:15Z"},"committer":{"name":"Jia Zhai","email":"zhaijia@apache.org","date":"2018-03-29T13:17:15Z"},"message":"Use reflection based CRC32 to pass direct memory pointer\n\nThe crc update with the bytebuffer is very expensive, especially in netty > 4.1.12.\n\n```java\ncrc.get().update(data.nioBuffer());\n```\n\nConverting a direct`ByteBuf` into a `ByteBuffer` with `data.nioBuffer()` is actually resorting to allocating an unpooled `DirectByteBuffer` which is actually killing the GC (since direct memory is freed when the `DirectByteBuffer` instances are GCed, but the pauses are > 1 second).\n\nThis is an adaptation of a change from Yahoo branch at https://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/commit/6c01ca2921a998f3bf2e85cacb27867773e7ea28\n\nInitially I though this change was not needed anymore in 4.7 codebase, and that is true for the CRC32c variant.

One thing to note is that\nI've made a copy of the close and closeAsync methods in the\nWriteHandle interface, so that the ReadHandle and Handle javadoc for\nthese methods do not have to talk about what it means to close/seal a\nledger.\n\nAnother change is that I've removed the SneakyThrows from close, that\nwould have also been needed on the other sync methods.

By taking the `Object...` we're effectively taking a `Object[]` that is allocated each time, along with the boxing for ledgerId/entryId.\n\nRefactored the code separate the logging and the status code conversion, so that we can skip the allocation when debug is off.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1291 from merlimat/log-and-convert-status","tree":{"sha":"eaf904e9d87686872870ecfbe44f98485c438197","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/eaf904e9d87686872870ecfbe44f98485c438197"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/4fe823ba19b86abecaf575b009c55b5d8da51b90","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/4fe823ba19b86abecaf575b009c55b5d8da51b90","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/4fe823ba19b86abecaf575b009c55b5d8da51b90","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/4fe823ba19b86abecaf575b009c55b5d8da51b90/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1bd2c0eef3af8810e70116633b95c4133183d873","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1bd2c0eef3af8810e70116633b95c4133183d873","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1bd2c0eef3af8810e70116633b95c4133183d873"}]},{"sha":"1bd2c0eef3af8810e70116633b95c4133183d873","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjFiZDJjMGVlZjNhZjg4MTBlNzAxMTY2MzNiOTVjNDEzMzE4M2Q4NzM=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-03-24T21:41:42Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-03-24T21:41:42Z"},"message":"Improve FileInfoBackingCache\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThere are a couple of issues noticed in FileInfoBackingCache:\n\n1) There is a race condition in loadFileInfo between get-check and put.

DbLedgerStorage\n\nThis PR contain 2 changes that are much related to each other.\n\n1. Changed DbLedgerStorage write cache read-write lock into a `StampedLock`\n   Main reason for using `StampedLock` is that this lock is always taken as a \"read\" lock, when putting entries in the the cache. It is protecting for the swapping of the write cache when the flush is triggered. Most of the time, we have many threads acquiring the read-lock. `StampedLock` is better in this scenario because there isn't any contention in the optimistic path (just a double volatile read).\n\n2. Have a configurable throttle timing when the write cache is really full.\n    If we try to write faster than we can put data in the storage device, eventually both write caches will get full and we have to throttle writes.

In this case the map is only updated when new ledgers are added / removed, but we do a `get()` on each `addEntry()` operation.\n  - Schedule periodical cleanup of the map for stale ledger info entries\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1264 from merlimat/refactor-lac-cache-db-ledger-storage","tree":{"sha":"b4e58afed268118fb3e15a5fdaaa224919cb266b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/b4e58afed268118fb3e15a5fdaaa224919cb266b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/76ba8e294e151092abe1e195009314fdd6eaa64a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/76ba8e294e151092abe1e195009314fdd6eaa64a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/76ba8e294e151092abe1e195009314fdd6eaa64a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/76ba8e294e151092abe1e195009314fdd6eaa64a/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"b53c0c3370c42d753afb852824ea12d2dbce4f2e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/b53c0c3370c42d753afb852824ea12d2dbce4f2e","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/b53c0c3370c42d753afb852824ea12d2dbce4f2e"}]},{"sha":"b53c0c3370c42d753afb852824ea12d2dbce4f2e","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmI1M2MwYzMzNzBjNDJkNzUzYWZiODUyODI0ZWExMmQyZGJjZTRmMmU=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-03-16T05:27:49Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-03-16T05:27:49Z"},"message":"BP-29 (task 4): use metadata service uri for constructing registration manager and ledger manager factory\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThe main changes are at two places:\n\n- Deprecating using ServerConfiguration#getRegistrationManagerClass().

branch:\nhttps://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/tree/yahoo-4.3/bookkeeper-stats-providers/datasketches-metrics-provider/src/main/java/org/apache/bokkeeper/stats/datasketches\n\nThis is based on the [DataSketches](https://datasketches.github.io/) library to have very fast and lightweight quantile estimates (along with a number of other operations), plus some tricks to avoid concurrency issues by using thread local collectors and aggregating when needed in background.\n\nAfter the change, the throughput is 150x the original prometheus collector.\n\n```\nBenchmark

to the stat logger.\n\n`System.nanoTime()` is not super fast:\n\n```\nBenchmark                               (statsProvider)   Mode  Cnt    Score     Error

write cache flush in DbLedgerStorage\n\n`DbLedgerStorage` uses an in-memory write cache to accumulate entries before writing into the entry log.\n\nThe flush of the write cache is triggered by 2 factors:\n 1. `SyncThread` issuing a checkpoint (eg: every 10sec or 1min)\n 2. Write cache is full, so we need to force the flush\n\nIn case (1), the checkpoint is also communicated to the journal which can then move the `logMark` forward and eventually discard old unused journals.\n\nIn cae (2), we're not moving the `logMark`. This has few side effects:\n 1. When restarting the bookie it will replay a bigger portion of the journal\n 2. We are moving the `logMark` only every 1min, so we need to keep 1minute of journals on disk\n    - If the disk hosting the journal(s) has low capacity, it can fill it up\n    - This is evident when mounting the journal on a 60GB ram-disk and using 8 journals in the bookie. At a sufficient rate, the write cache keeps getting flushed, but the journals are only trimmed after 1 minute, thus accumulating 1min worth of writes in the journal device, filling up the space.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1261 from

just make sure the 'new ledger' journal entry is added after an entry is added to ledger storage. so it make sure when checkpoint happen it will flush and create the ledger before moving the journal mark.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Charan Reddy Guttapalem <reddycharan18@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>, Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1256 from sijie/fix_db_ledger_storage_checkpoint, closes #1255","tree":{"sha":"ca6e873f5e36d1936c3d1a629815b87941cd93c4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/ca6e873f5e36d1936c3d1a629815b87941cd93c4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294"}]},{"sha":"96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2Ojk2ZmYxYzBkNDRiZjFhYzZiMGNlM2NhMjEwNTNhZTEwYWI3ZTIyOTQ=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-03-14T14:20:03Z"},"committer":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-03-14T14:20:03Z"},"message":"Jenkins seed job for testing DSLs\n\nThe job allows you to specify a repo and a branch.

ExplicitLac in db ledger storage\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nDbLedgerStorage was developed in yahoo and just merged recently to master. This implementation only works for v2 protocol.\nIt doesn't work with v3 protocol. When using v3 protocol clients (e.g. dlog library) to talk to bookies use DbLedgerStorage,\nthe clients hang on waiting responses. because a few methods in DbLedgerStorage throw UnsupportedException\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis change focuses on adding the implementations for those methods, in order to support LacPiggyback, LongPoll and ExplicitLac\nfor v3 protocol. The implementation follows what we had in FileInfoCache but did it in a much simpler way, since all the persistence\ninformation has been managed by db ledger storage itself. All the information required by `LacPiggyback`, `LongPoll` and `ExplicitLac`\nare transient.\n\nThis change doesn't introduce any new test cases. It reuses existing test cases to test those features using DbLedgerStorage. These\ntests are:\n\n- ExplicitLacTest: for testing explicit lac\n- TestPiggybackLAC: for testing piggback lac\n- TestReadLastConfirmedLongPoll: for testing long polling lac\n- TestReadLastConfirmedAndEntry: for testing entry piggyback\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1218

recovery reads/writes\n\nThe change adds a new flag for reads, RECOVERY_READ. This flag is set\nwhen a client is retrying to recover a ledger. Recovery reads should\nbe higher priority than normal reads, as recovery usually happens when\na writer has failed, and another node needs to take over the stream\nthat that ledger belonged to. All writes on that stream are blocked\nuntil the ledger the ledger has been recovered, so giving these reads\npriority will mean the stream is out for action for the shortest\namount of time possible.\n\nPriority is given to these reads by executing the reads directly in\nthe BookieRequestProcessor, rather than adding them to the\nreadThreadPool where they could end up queuing.\n\nThis change was originally 372a99db in the yahoo.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <None>\n\nThis closes #898 from ivankelly/yahoo-bp-10","tree":{"sha":"7e4b8eee489030194e47fe271627e60f1977e44b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/7e4b8eee489030194e47fe271627e60f1977e44b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3"}]},{"sha":"538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjUzOGFlZTllOGJiNWVmNzJmYTc4MGY3NmRiYTJiMzI3MDFjOTQ3YjM=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-28T02:09:55Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-28T02:09:55Z"},"message":"Use the bk OrderedScheduler in dlog\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nDlog has an implementation of OrderedScheduler inspired of bk `OrderedScheduler`.

All ledgers and data are just kept in an hashmap in memory.\n\nIt is possible to inject failure in the sync/async calls, even after N steps.
