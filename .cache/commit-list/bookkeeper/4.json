#2506: Skip unavailable bookies during verifyLedgerFragment\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `verifyLedgerFragment` method in the `LedgerChecker` by skipping calls to bookies that are known to be unavailable. The \"bad bookies\" are calculated by using metadata available in ZK and accessed by the `BookKeeperAdmin`. Note that `verifyLedgerFragment` will still run checks on all other bookies that appear available.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is demonstrated in #2506. As this code currently works, there are a ton of calls made to unavailable bookies with the intent of calculating bad (unavailable) bookies. This proposed change would greatly decrease the number of calls that the auditor and the replicator need to make to calculate which ledgers need replicating.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Added `getUnavailableBookies` method to the `BookKeeperAdmin`. This method could attempt to use caching, but it's not actually called that often, so I think caching might not add complexity without much value.\r\n2. Updated `verifyLedgerFragment` method signature to take a collection of `unavailableBookies`.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2506\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIf these changes are acceptable, I'd like some help identifying the best way to test these changes. I already added some coverage for the `getUnavailableBookies` method, but I haven't explicitly tested the fundamental change this PR proposes.

Some Clarifications to the AutoRecovery Documentation\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nI recently started using Apache Bookkeeper as part of my Apache Pulsar cluster. In learning some of the operational tasks related to managing the bookies and autorecovery, I noticed a few places where the documentation could be improved.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe changes are all to the `AutoRecovery.md` file for version 4.12.0. They might apply to earlier versions, but I'm not sure how documentation updates are handled. My first change is to explicitly mention the way to turn off the AutoRecovery daemon on the bookie nodes. This configuration was not obvious to me as a new user of the project, and I accidentally had recovery workers running on all nodes. (Regarding that, I mention in the PR that it is possible to run the process on bookie and autorecovery nodes. Perhaps this isn't an intended use case though? If that is so, it should be mentioned in the documentation.) I also added a clarification to the `disable` auto recovery documentation because it wasn't obvious to me that running the script would stop autorecovery for the whole cluster.\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <None>\n\nThis closes #2507 from michaeljmarshall/document-autorecovery-more","tree":{"sha":"1ab0c2d1af60003109ae5a2760925db084207ec3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/1ab0c2d1af60003109ae5a2760925db084207ec3"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/00622bce6279ecf40fe044abe5bd7a29722b2535","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJfzZkFCRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAAdHIIAAbQSGwyf9L3zx6MWY2w8uVX\novVWiVbEGnaw8Sv/BXFTW7wA3KjAhXN2DUA52CO0HCsEj9DwQC30JrAf3H9N6phI\nRHKuEXUATJ5gpiUjd6mZaaJjT4Kn6XBSjEVHpY0ZwXRaBqcokjShT+raspCqDw2A\neAiliw2TewtxA2BhcI/OmS3wOhnfVKyMMNwu1gg9iD4AcWTNy4eYoDpDu1gwF79D\nGPbK0Ml8umKnlbKCx4gxzKxRjnLIXiz7zZKf3C2/+OvkliUc1bBuXwbwY0ps4uxV\nkYtFAkbd/s6uGjRwuV6EooXSiHrDslV3pQFG4QGBgLWeb9sC7518gGUEjlWOWgI=\n=opRJ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 1ab0c2d1af60003109ae5a2760925db084207ec3\nparent 63b3e5a0759f05fde752cc5ade07ea19a8f2b114\nauthor Michael Marshall <47911938+michaeljmarshall@users.noreply.github.com> 1607309573 -0700\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1607309573 -0800\n\nAdd Some Clarifications to the AutoRecovery Documentation\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nI recently started using Apache Bookkeeper as part of my Apache Pulsar cluster.

In `AbstractChannel#filterOutboundMessage()`, netty copies that data to a direct buffer if\r\nit is currently in heap (otherwise skips it and uses it directly).\r\nThis change helps in reducing unncessary CPU cycles for buffer copies and also helps alleviate pressure off the GC, since there is\r\nless churn of memory. In some stress tests, I see a reduction upto 33% in number of GC's with the same avg running duration in BK Client.\r\nThe workload does writes of different sizes, ranging from 1 KB to 512 KB.\r\nBookies aren't usually CPU bound. This change improves READ_ENTRY code paths by a small factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nUsed direct memory for buffer allocation versus heap memory\r\n\r\n\r\n* Added comments"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/a659cf50fe46cfea801199df559663abad0eeaa5","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/a659cf50fe46cfea801199df559663abad0eeaa5","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/a659cf50fe46cfea801199df559663abad0eeaa5/comments","author":{"login":"karanmehta93","id":6191256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6191256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93","html_url":"https://github.com/karanmehta93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"85cd302291784dc8502172303ad3a315a15566f3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/85cd302291784dc8502172303ad3a315a15566f3","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/85cd302291784dc8502172303ad3a315a15566f3"}]},{"sha":"85cd302291784dc8502172303ad3a315a15566f3","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2Ojg1Y2QzMDIyOTE3ODRkYzg1MDIxNzIzMDNhZDNhMzE1YTE1NTY2ZjM=","commit":{"author":{"name":"karanmehta93","email":"k.mehta@salesforce.com","date":"2020-11-03T10:05:45Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2020-11-03T10:05:45Z"},"message":"ZookeeperClient should retry instantly on zk session expiry (#2450)\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, we wait for `sessionTimeoutMs` before initiating a new zk cnxn.
