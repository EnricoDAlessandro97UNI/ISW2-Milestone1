`dir_*_usage`\r\nstats as `0` until it becomes writable again.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` only updating\r\n`diskUsages` if there are any writable dirs, or if the total usage\r\ngoes below the low water mark, otherwise relying on previously filled\r\nvalues which are `0` after a bookie is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Change the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` to update `diskUsages`\r\n  even when there are no writable dirs.\r\n* Add new `testLedgerDirsMonitorStartReadOnly` testing this scenario.\r\n* Simplify previous tests checking read-only since `diskUsages`\r\n  are now updated regardless if a bookie is in read-only mode.\r\n\r\njvrao reddycharan \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Charan Reddy Guttapalem

for Sorted/InterleavedLedgerStorage\n\nThe main goal of this patch is the ScrubberService LifecycleComponent\r\nwhich runs in the background periodically verifying the internal\r\nconsistency of the

I changed the endpoint to\r\n192.0.2.0/24 range (TEST-NET) to avoid a similar scenario in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1826 from ivankelly/auditor-bookie-flake"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ac7c567f81376dcf277467f2097a90c101de447b","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/ac7c567f81376dcf277467f2097a90c101de447b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/ac7c567f81376dcf277467f2097a90c101de447b/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"f49bd035db01f5b50df88c6c43329f7824984181","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/f49bd035db01f5b50df88c6c43329f7824984181","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/f49bd035db01f5b50df88c6c43329f7824984181"}]},{"sha":"f49bd035db01f5b50df88c6c43329f7824984181","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OmY0OWJkMDM1ZGIwMWY1YjUwZGY4OGM2YzQzMzI5Zjc4MjQ5ODQxODE=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-11-22T01:42:45Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2018-11-22T01:42:45Z"},"message":"LedgerMetadata#parseConfig uses Metadata Builder\n\nparseConfig is one of the main places that mutates member fields of\r\nLedgerMetadata.

should bypass OSE Threads\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nProfiling of our Bookkeeper Client code for read requests shows that client threads spend half of their time in dispatching requests to OrderedExecutors (just the dispatch itself, not the execution inside OSE): 54% of their CPU time is spent in OrderedExecutor.executeOrdered() (called by LedgerHandle.readEntriesInternalAsync()). The high time spend in request submission to OSE is largely caused by Linux scheduling cost, that is the cost of dispatching the OSE thread to CPU: 42% of total time (3/4th of executeOrdered() time), threads spend in Unsafe.unpark(), which is essentially Linux scheduling/dispatching of another thread.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis change executes read submissions (PendingReadOp) on read-only ledger handles directly inside the client thread instead of submitting them to Ordered Executors.\r\n\r\nTests with a prototype have shown significant improvements in both overall CPU consumption as well as read latency. The additional work client threads have to do (the dispatch of the read requests to netty) is roughly the same as the (saved) dispatch cost to OSE, so the change turns out to be neutral for CPU consumption of client threads. In some experiments, the savings even exceed the additional work, and client threads consume less cpu even though they \"do more\". It also frees up lots of resources in OSE threads. Since it eliminates one context-switch in read submission and also avoids serialization of reads to the same ledger (or ledgers hashing to the same OSE), it also reduces read latency. For a mixed read-write workload (14,000 reads/sec on read-only ledgers, 4,000 writes/sec on another set of ledgers), this change has reduced CPU consumption of OSE threads by 25%, kept CPU consumption of client (and Netty) threads the same, and yielded a 6% improvement of read latency (as measured by BK Client).\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #1791: Read Submission should bypass OSE Threads\r\n\n\nReviewers:

FileInfo provides a convenient point of\r\nsynchronization for avoinding this race.  FileInfo.moveLedgerIndexFile,\r\nFileInfo.flushHeader, and FileInfo.delete() are synchronized already, so\r\nthis patch simply adds a deleted flag to the FileInfo object to indicate\r\nthat the FileInfo has become invalid.  checkOpen is called in every\r\nmethod and will now throw FileInfoDeleted if delete has been called.\r\nIndexPersistenceManager can catch it and deal with it appropriately in\r\nflush (which generally means moving onto the next ledger).\r\n\r\nThis patch also eliminates ledgersToFlush and ledgersFlushing.  Their\r\npurpose appears to be to allow delete to avoid flushing a ledger which\r\nhas been selected for flushing but not flushed yet avoiding the above\r\nrace.  It's not sufficient, however, because IndexInMemPageMgr calls\r\nIndexPersistenceManager.flushLedgerHeader, which can obtain a FileInfo\r\nfor the ledger prior to the deletion and then call\r\nrelocateIndexFileAndFlushHeader afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the purpose was to avoid concurrent calls into\r\nflushSpecificLedger on the same ledger, it's wrong because of the\r\nfollowing sequence:\r\n\r\nt0: thread 0 calls flushOneOrMoreLedgers\r\nt1: thread 0 place ledger 10 into ledgersFlushing and completes\r\nflushSpecificLedger\r\nt2: thread 2 performs a write to ledger 10\r\nt3: thread 1 calls flushOneOrMoreLedgers skipping ledger 10\r\nt4: thread 0 releases ledger 10 from ledgersFlushing\r\nt5: thread 1 completes flushOneOrMoreLedgers\r\n\r\nAlthough thread 1 begins to flush after the write to ledger 10, it won't\r\ncapture the write rendering the flush incorrect.

FileInfo provides a convenient point of\r\nsynchronization for avoinding this race.  FileInfo.moveLedgerIndexFile,\r\nFileInfo.flushHeader, and FileInfo.delete() are synchronized already, so\r\nthis patch simply adds a deleted flag to the FileInfo object to indicate\r\nthat the FileInfo has become invalid.  checkOpen is called in every\r\nmethod and will now throw FileInfoDeleted if delete has been called.\r\nIndexPersistenceManager can catch it and deal with it appropriately in\r\nflush (which generally means moving onto the next ledger).\r\n\r\nThis patch also eliminates ledgersToFlush and ledgersFlushing.  Their\r\npurpose appears to be to allow delete to avoid flushing a ledger which\r\nhas been selected for flushing but not flushed yet avoiding the above\r\nrace.  It's not sufficient, however, because IndexInMemPageMgr calls\r\nIndexPersistenceManager.flushLedgerHeader, which can obtain a FileInfo\r\nfor the ledger prior to the deletion and then call\r\nrelocateIndexFileAndFlushHeader afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the purpose was to avoid concurrent calls into\r\nflushSpecificLedger on the same ledger, it's wrong because of the\r\nfollowing sequence:\r\n\r\nt0: thread 0 calls flushOneOrMoreLedgers\r\nt1: thread 0 place ledger 10 into ledgersFlushing and completes\r\nflushSpecificLedger\r\nt2: thread 2 performs a write to ledger 10\r\nt3: thread 1 calls flushOneOrMoreLedgers skipping ledger 10\r\nt4: thread 0 releases ledger 10 from ledgersFlushing\r\nt5: thread 1 completes flushOneOrMoreLedgers\r\n\r\nAlthough thread 1 begins to flush after the write to ledger 10, it won't\r\ncapture the write rendering the flush incorrect.  I don't think it's\r\nactually worth avoiding overlapping flushes here because both FileInfo\r\nand LedgerEntryPage track dirty state.  As such, it seems simpler to\r\njust get rid of them.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds a more agressive version of testFlushDeleteRace to\r\ntest the new behavior.  Testing with multiple flushers turned up a bug\r\nwith LedgerEntryPage.getPageToWrite where didn't return a buffer with\r\nindependent read pointers, so this patch addresses that as well.\r\n\r\n(bug

of a bookie changes, the BK client will continue to use the old IP address.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nConstruct a new `InetSocketAddress` each time `getSocketAddress()` gets called (eg: each time we

Motivation\r\n\r\nConfiguring the correct JVM memory settings and cache sizes for a BookKeeper cluster should be simplified.\r\n\r\nThere are currently many knobs in Netty or JVM flags for different components and while with a good setup the systems is very stable, it's easy to setup non-optimal configurations which might result in OutOfMemory errors under load.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there should be very minimal configuration required to bring up a BookKeeper cluster that can work under a wide set of traffic loads. In any case, we should prefer to automatically fallback to slower alternatives, when possible, instead of throwing OOM exceptions.\r\n\r\n * Provide a wrapper to have a single unified configuration point for Netty allocator configuration.\r\n * Provide fallback policy when dealing with direct memory OOM errors\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n * This is the first PR. It only contains the allocator wrapper implementation. Subsequent PR will add the changes to use it.\r\n * Added `bookkeeper-common-allocator` module to have a no-dependencues module that can be used directly from Pulsar client library too (which doesn't depend on BK).\r\n\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <guosijie@gmail.com>\nAuthor: Charan Reddy Guttapalem <reddycharan18@gmail.com>\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\nAuthor: Andrey Yegorov <dlg99@users.noreply.github.com>\nAuthor: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Qi Wang <None>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1754 from merlimat/allocator","tree":{"sha":"7f3c163f6649ac6b984dd2c3278e1a56f3ee43a8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/7f3c163f6649ac6b984dd2c3278e1a56f3ee43a8"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/379d2ba8570eed1f92f8a468158f1a2d0861aaa6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/379d2ba8570eed1f92f8a468158f1a2d0861aaa6","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/379d2ba8570eed1f92f8a468158f1a2d0861aaa6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/379d2ba8570eed1f92f8a468158f1a2d0861aaa6/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"7016d0af6850ae565cc674a6d286782bbb5ba33a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7016d0af6850ae565cc674a6d286782bbb5ba33a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/7016d0af6850ae565cc674a6d286782bbb5ba33a"}]}]
