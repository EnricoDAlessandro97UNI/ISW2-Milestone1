getFileInfo\n\nThe argument to assertions is not evaluated if assertions is disabled,\nwhich was messing up the refcounting for the fileinfo backing\ncache. We ended up with dead fileinfo objects in the guava caches,\nwhich triggered an infinite loop.\n\nThis patch fixes that by moving the tryRetain() out of the assert. It\nalso adds defensive code to getFileInfo to ensure that if a fileinfo\nobject is dead, that it doesn't exist any longer in the caches.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico
