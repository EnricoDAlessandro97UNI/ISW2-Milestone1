TestBackwardCompat.testCompat410 often fails due to io.netty.util.IllegalReferenceCountException\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nProblem:\n\nin TestBackwardCompat#testCompact400, the test is to verify the current client can't talk to a 4.0.0 server.\n\nThe 4.5.0 client is sending a protobuf encoded request to 4.0.0 server. The 4.0.0 server will interpret the 4.5.0 protobuf encoded request, but it will realize this is bad request and sending v2 protocol encoded response. because the request is a bad request, 4.0.0 server sent a response back with unknown op code.\n\nIn current v2 ResponseEnDecoder (listed as below), when it doesn't know the op code, it will return the buffer to the channel. this might cause the misbehavior in the channel pipeline to decrement reference count.\n\nSolution:\n\nthrow exception in the EnDeCoder when receiving unknown op code. so the netty can close the connection, error out the pending requests and cleaning up the resources.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Matteo Merli <None>\n\nThis closes #219 from sijie/issue_198, closes #198","tree":{"sha":"67ae0fb04cb2f2bbd8c1c1e9653d1f2db7f85e15","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/67ae0fb04cb2f2bbd8c1c1e9653d1f2db7f85e15"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147"}]},{"sha":"5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjVlMzk5ZGY2N2MyYWExZTVmMjI4YzYyYmE4NTMzY2EzMjkzYWIxNDc=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijieg@twitter.com","date":"2017-06-29T22:12:40Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2017-06-29T22:12:40Z"},"message":"BOOKKEEPER-759: Delay Ensemble Change & Disable Ensemble Change\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis pull request contains the changes around ensemble change.\n\n- Delay Ensemble Change: Provide a flag to allow delay ensemble change. if that is set to change, will not do ensemble change until it breaks ack quorum requirements.\n- Disable Ensemble Change: Provide a runtime feature flag to allow disabling ensemble change.

ZkUnderreplicationManager cache watcher\n\nPreviously, getLedgerToReplicate left watches each time it traversed the\ntree until it found a suitable replication target.  Since we don't have\na way of canceling watches, these watches tended to get abandoned,\nparticularly on interior nodes, which aren't changed much.  Thus,\nover time, some nodes would build up a very large number of watch.\n\nInstead, introduce a caching mechanism to remember outstanding watches\nand avoid ever creating two watches on the same node.\n\nAuthor: Samuel Just <sjustsalesforce.com>\n\nAuthor: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #193 from athanatos/forupstream/BOOKKEEPER-1098","tree":{"sha":"592639cb9c2a0fe7d7aedca8c27cb64bcbba1c87","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/592639cb9c2a0fe7d7aedca8c27cb64bcbba1c87"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/32c2859f0bec9ab74965d954bce038480e4dc2ba","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/32c2859f0bec9ab74965d954bce038480e4dc2ba","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/32c2859f0bec9ab74965d954bce038480e4dc2ba","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/32c2859f0bec9ab74965d954bce038480e4dc2ba/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9ddd9e6f9e48b03a57a2c78ec2630303abd49782","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9ddd9e6f9e48b03a57a2c78ec2630303abd49782","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9ddd9e6f9e48b03a57a2c78ec2630303abd49782"}]},{"sha":"9ddd9e6f9e48b03a57a2c78ec2630303abd49782","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjlkZGQ5ZTZmOWU0OGIwM2E1N2EyYzc4ZWMyNjMwMzAzYWJkNDk3ODI=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Charan Reddy Guttapalem","email":"cguttapalem@salesforce.com","date":"2017-06-28T21:24:05Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2017-06-28T21:24:05Z"},"message":"BOOKKEEPER-1034: Bookie start in RO when diskfull\n\nWhen the disk is above threshold, Bookie goes to RO.

open a ledger. This is caused by allocating a 4KB buffer (in TextFormat.toStringBuilder) to account for the maximum possible Protobufs message, which is unnecessary in our case: we know the exact size of the metadata ( << 500 B) and don't need to allocate more.\nTextFormat.merge(Readable, Message.Builder) is the current method we use. This changes to use TextFormat.merge(CharSequence, Message.Builder), which avoids the extra 4K allocation conversion + an extra StringBuilder.\n\nRB_ID=745700\n\nAuthor: Alex Yarmula

ByteBuf in LedgerEntry to avoid data copy\n\nTo avoid copying the entries payloads when writing/reading on a ledger and having to allocate a lot of `byte[]` on the JVM heap, we need to accept Netty ByteBuf buffer.\n\nBy passing a ByteBuf, an application can use a pooled buffer, pointing to direct memory, to the `LedgerHandle.addEntry()` and have the same buffer forwarded on the connection sockets to the bookies.\n\nThe same thing on the read side, `LedgerEntry` exposes an additional `getEntryBuffer()` method that can be used to get the underlying buffer and possibly forward that to some other connection, with zero-copy behavior (excluding getting data in-out of the kernel).\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai, Sijie Guo, Enrico
