The race happens when the maps gets re-hashed after the expansion and the new arrays are substituting the old ones.\n\nThe race itself is that a thread doing a `get()` on the map is first checking the current `capacity` of the map, uses that to get the bucket and then tries to do optimistic read of the value in that bucket.\n\nThis assumes `capacity` update is visible only after the `values` array is already swapped, but that is not always the case in current code.\n\n### Changes\n * Use `volatile` qualifier for `capacity` and `values` arrays to ensure ordering of memory read is respected by compiler\n * In rehashing, update `capacity` after `values`\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes

in PCBC with custom impl\n\nFor a long time PerChannelBookieClient has used guava\nLinkedListMultiMap to store conflicting V2 completion keys and\nvalues. This is problematic though. Completion keys are pooled\nobjects. When a key-value pair is stored in a LinkedListMultiMap, if\nit is the first value for that key, a collection is created for the\nvalues, and added to a top-level map using the key, and then the key\nand the value are added to the collection. When a second value is\nadded for the same key, the key and value are simply added to the\ncollection. The problem occurs when the first key is removed. PBCB\nwill recycle the key object, but this object is still being used in\nthe multimap in the top-level map. This causes all sorts of fun like\nNullPointerException and IllegalStateException.\n\nBecause of this, this patch introduces a very simple multimap\nimplementation that only stores the key one time (in the collection)\nand uses the hashCode of the key to separate the collections into\nbuckets. It's pretty inefficient, but this code it only hit in the\nrare case where a client is trying to read or write the same entry\nfrom the same ledger more than once at the same time.\n\nAuthor: Ivan

To\nPerChannelBookieClient these look no different to normal writes.\n\nIf a client tries to open a ledger multiple times concurrently,\ncurrently some of the attempts can hang forever since there is no\nsupport for concurrent writes.\n\nThis patch adds support for concurrent writes, so multiple concurrent\nledger open attempts will always complete (though some may fail for\nunrelated reasons).\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivan@ivankelly.net>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1547 from ivankelly/conc-open","tree":{"sha":"cf653384ec4e675c484fac3c51ee1ffc2c1daa28","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/cf653384ec4e675c484fac3c51ee1ffc2c1daa28"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/424204ebecb8ba2e4856cb2f570f3a8bf1589da8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/424204ebecb8ba2e4856cb2f570f3a8bf1589da8","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/424204ebecb8ba2e4856cb2f570f3a8bf1589da8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/424204ebecb8ba2e4856cb2f570f3a8bf1589da8/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1d8366a0a2468856d3a5671d36b17f542cb0c75c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1d8366a0a2468856d3a5671d36b17f542cb0c75c","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1d8366a0a2468856d3a5671d36b17f542cb0c75c"}]},{"sha":"1d8366a0a2468856d3a5671d36b17f542cb0c75c","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjFkODM2NmEwYTI0Njg4NTZkM2E1NjcxZDM2YjE3ZjU0MmNiMGM3NWM=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-07-23T14:36:20Z"},"committer":{"name":"Enrico Olivelli","email":"eolivelli@apache.org","date":"2018-07-23T14:36:20Z"},"message":"[TABLE SERVICE] Improve bin/bookkeeper standalone to start all available service components\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrently `bin/bookkeeper standalone` simply starts local bookies.

Motivation\n\nReadOnlyBookie doesn't sets shutdownHandler to its statemanager.\n\nThere are couple of issues with how 'stateManager' is handled in ReadOnlyBookie,\n\n- ReadOnlyBookie creates its own stateManager in its constructor but it does not sets shutdownHandler.\n- Also, it is not correct to create stateManager instance in Bookie constructor and then again in ReadOnlyBookie constructor and override the instance created in super constructor.\n\n### Changes\n\n- move initializeStateManager logic to a method and override it in ReadOnlyBookie.\n\nMaster Issue: #1541\n\nAuthor: cguttapalem

For writes, latencies of individual bookies are masked by acknowledging the client after a quorum of bookies have replied. However for reads, we don't have any equivalent feature to mask short-term latencies of individual bookies yet (in case of SequenceReadRequests). This PR implements such a feature by reordering reads to prefer bookies with a high probability of being fast over bookies that are potentially slow.\n\n### Changes\nThis change implements a configurable reordering of read requests in Bokkeeper client based on the number of pending requests to each bookie that could service the request. The intention is to mask the latency of one bookie by directing a read request to another bookie that could potentially service the request faster. This should help prevent read time outliers due to bookies that temporarily are responsing slow, for example due to Java garbage collection, compaction, or any other kind of hickup. Unlike the implementation for Issue #709, this algorithm quickly reacts to both an or decrease increase in queue length of a bookie relative to others, and allows to redirect requests long before they would hit the speculativeReadTimeout. Once the problem is resolved (e.g. Java GC finished), it will quickly direct requests to the previously \"slow\" bookie as its queue length decreases.\n\nReordering of reads is based on a threshold of relative queue length to other bookies. Setting the threshold very low will more frequently reorder the read set and potentially result in better latency, but will also reduce data affinity of reads. Reads send to other than the preferred bookie have a low chance to be served from file system cache on that bookie, and will likely result in a physical read. Small thresholds therefore shuffle read requests more among bookies and may lead to reduced file system cache reach and increased physical reads on disks. A larger timeout will maintain data affinity and avoid above problems, but only kick in once a bookie has built-up a considerable queue of requests. It therefore masks only slightly larger outliers, and leads to overall better efficiency.\n\nMaster Issue: #1489\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Michael <nmichael@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1504 from nicmichael/ReadReordering, closes #1489","tree":{"sha":"e22cfac8749bcddae6e9b3fa13008109ad118f03","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/e22cfac8749bcddae6e9b3fa13008109ad118f03"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9/comments","author":{"login":"nicmichael","id":27270046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjcwMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27270046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael","html_url":"https://github.com/nicmichael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff"}]},{"sha":"9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjlmNTVmNzg4MTVjODBkNmIzMzVkOGUxY2Y2ZmQ5MTE5NmFlYjhjZmY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-14T00:35:34Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-14T00:35:34Z"},"message":"Allow to configure read-only mode in ZooKeeperClient\n\nUnderlying `Zookeeper` instance has an option to specify the client is fine to remain connected when the ZK quorum is lost, just in read-only mode.\n\nWe should expose the \"allow read-only mode\" option in `ZooKeeperClient`.\n\nOne example of use case for this flag is when connecting to a ZK ensemble that is just used for configuration/metadata store, in which no ephemeral nodes are used.

This PR tends to address the problem.\n\n*Solution*\n\nUse `ghprbTargetBranch` as the build branch for precommit jobs.\n\nBesides that, split the validation goals (e.g. checkstyle, apache-rat) from build/test goals (package, spotbugs), this reduces build time for different jdk versions and address problem when running checkstyle:check with other goals (e.g. deploy).\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1475 from sijie/run_precommit_jobs_over_target_branches","tree":{"sha":"8f8adf887e4e5942052fcaf6bf3941fd192d6f26","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/8f8adf887e4e5942052fcaf6bf3941fd192d6f26"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/9e937cfc9da15521fff1946ad3470d1f35b3b016","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9e937cfc9da15521fff1946ad3470d1f35b3b016","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/9e937cfc9da15521fff1946ad3470d1f35b3b016","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/9e937cfc9da15521fff1946ad3470d1f35b3b016/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"7a2612076eba9fbfd32aa177c66e4a1d0b58edf6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/7a2612076eba9fbfd32aa177c66e4a1d0b58edf6","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/7a2612076eba9fbfd32aa177c66e4a1d0b58edf6"}]},{"sha":"7a2612076eba9fbfd32aa177c66e4a1d0b58edf6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjdhMjYxMjA3NmViYTlmYmZkMzJhYTE3N2M2NmU0YTFkMGI1OGVkZjY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-04T20:00:04Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-04T20:00:04Z"},"message":"Improve merge script to merge PRs based on branches\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nMerge script doesn't handle well on handling PRs based on branches.

After a release is approved, create the final release tag.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1451 from sijie/update_release_guid","tree":{"sha":"61862c382c173bf8d9e164a3a0e783c1a82d0dfa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/61862c382c173bf8d9e164a3a0e783c1a82d0dfa"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/254b4464ca2a8775afb3b1ac2eba57ca920b36a4","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/254b4464ca2a8775afb3b1ac2eba57ca920b36a4","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/254b4464ca2a8775afb3b1ac2eba57ca920b36a4","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/254b4464ca2a8775afb3b1ac2eba57ca920b36a4/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108"}]},{"sha":"16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjE2ZWYyNWI2NGVmM2Y5YTNiZWYwMGEzODJkYzFhZTJhNThiZGQxMDg=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-30T07:55:27Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-30T07:55:27Z"},"message":"Allow CI to publish a snapshot version with gitsha information\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrently bookkeeper publishes a snapshot release nightly to maven artifacts. It provides a convenient solution for people to try out new bookkeeper releases as soon as the changes land in master branch. However sometime it is also problematic when you reference this snapshot version in other projects, subsequent changes in bookkeeper might potentially break those projects.\n\n*Solution*\n\nUpdate the CI to provide a mechanism to publish a snapshot version with gitsha information. so it can publish a snapshot version that is pinned to the given gitsha. so the projects can safely use a snapshot version for development without worrying bookkeeper changes break it.\n\n*NOTES*\n\nThe mechanism is a manual operation. It should be used when it is needed.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1454 from sijie/publish_snapshot_with_gitsha","tree":{"sha":"c8c5a201c8ef355af40a315149917db1e0b6766f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/c8c5a201c8ef355af40a315149917db1e0b6766f"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/16ef25b64ef3f9a3bef00a382dc1ae2a58bdd108/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"305e3fb327a4ef478b0c69a8a9389fd68c6cdd12","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/305e3fb327a4ef478b0c69a8a9389fd68c6cdd12","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/305e3fb327a4ef478b0c69a8a9389fd68c6cdd12"}]}]
