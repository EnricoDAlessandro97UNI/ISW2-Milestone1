on BufferedChannel\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nContention on `BufferedChannel` between the journal thread and the ForceWriteThread was introduced in #1228.\r\n\r\n`unpersistentBytes` is only used if `unpersistedBytesBound > 0`, which is not true by default. We shouldn't be paying the penalty if not needed.\r\n\r\nAlso `position` doesn't need to be `AtomicLong` since it's only updated while the mutex is taken.

scrutiny mentioned in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/site/bps/BP-34-cluster-metadata-checker.md\r\n- In this commit, urLedgersElapsedRecoveryGracePeriod check is added to placementPolicyCheck.\r\n- new scrutiny is added replicasCheck and it is disabled by default.\r\n- this is first part of replicas check, in this part currently metrics are not added and\r\nalso delayed replicas check for potentially faulty ledgers (failure in trying to get\r\ninfo. from Bookie of the ensembles of the ledger) is not added.\r\n- have to add more failure test scenarios for

As a result, the number of entry logs continues to increase and eventually it will run out of disk space.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe cause of the compaction stop is that the `compacting` flag remains true if `compactor.compact(entryLogMeta)` throws some exception.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/b2e099bbc7b13f13825fe78ab009ca132cb3a9ba/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/bookie/GarbageCollectorThread.java#L504-L519\r\n\r\nTherefore, fixed `GarbageCollectorThread` so that it set the compaction flag to false even if compaction of a specific entry log fails.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2103\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2121 from massakam/entry-log-compaction, closes #2103","tree":{"sha":"aba323b2bf23affec7f49186ffe047076f6a1be9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/aba323b2bf23affec7f49186ffe047076f6a1be9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a/comments","author":{"login":"massakam","id":22543882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQzODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22543882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam","html_url":"https://github.com/massakam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111"}]},{"sha":"6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjZiODkyYTQ1ZjAyYTZkOGQwYjFkMzMyMzVkNDEzNGQ5MWUzZWExMTE=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Rajan Dhabalia","email":"rdhabalia@apache.org","date":"2019-07-12T08:03:10Z"},"committer":{"name":"Enrico Olivelli","email":"eolivelli@gmail.com","date":"2019-07-12T08:03:10Z"},"message":"[BK-SERVER] Clean up over-replicated ledgers owned by different bookies\n\n### Motivation\r\nAs described at: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4632\r\n- Sometimes due to overreplication, bookie contains ledgers which are not owned by that bookie anymore and that bookie is not part of the ensemble-list of those ledgers. In this case, GC finds out those overreplicated ledgers and \r\n- deletes their index from dbStorage (rocksDB) and \r\n- tries to delete them from entrylog files.\r\n\r\nHowever, bookie doesn't delete them from entry-log files due to change made in [#870](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/870) where bookie avoids deleting ledger if znode of that ledger exists.\r\n\r\nBecause of that bookie ends up storing large number entrylog files with ledgers which are owned by different bookies.

Hence this PR proposes that the `lastLogMark` is updated to journal EOF instead of an arbitrary LONG.MAX_VALUE. The FileChannel interface defines that the implementors can pass in any long offset and the file handler should return EOF immediately when trying to read it. However it doesn't seem to be working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nUpdated `Journal#setLastLogMark()` method to accept an `scanOffset` instead of constant `LONG.MAX_VALUE`.\r\n\r\nivankelly eolivelli \n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #2105 from karanmehta93/master","tree":{"sha":"53fdaf670022cb7dc1da698abc84fa6eb63e75d7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/53fdaf670022cb7dc1da698abc84fa6eb63e75d7"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5/comments","author":{"login":"karanmehta93","id":6191256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6191256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93","html_url":"https://github.com/karanmehta93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58"}]},{"sha":"26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjI2ZTgwMDRlNmI5M2Y1YWNhZmY3ZjY5ZGJhMTQ1MTFhN2NmNDRkNTg=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Charan Reddy Guttapalem","email":"cguttapalem@salesforce.com","date":"2019-05-20T02:53:36Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"guosijie@gmail.com","date":"2019-05-20T02:53:36Z"},"message":"Fix flaky testIOVertexHTTPServerEndpointForARWithPrometheusProvider test\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- in testIOVertexHTTPServerEndpointForARWithPrometheusProvider test\r\nit is not correct to assume that Auditor would have been created and\r\nstarted completely when we complete AutoRecoveryMain.start and see it\r\nstatus as started.

blocking call in gc-thread\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nRight now, we have below 3 issues because of which gc thread gets blocked forever and it can't perform gc-task further. Below issues are mainly related to blocking call while doing zk-operation without timeout. \r\n\r\nbug-fixes:\r\n1. right now, [GC - ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/bookie/ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector.java#L142) passes timeout in millisecond to [LedgerManager](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/meta/LongHierarchicalLedgerManager.java#L166) but it \r\ntakes it as second and again try to convert it in millis so, 30Kms timeout becomes [30M ms timeout](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/util/ZkUtils.java#L245). Sp, fix timeout unit during gc.\r\n\r\n2. Right now, GC makes blocking call to get list of children on ledger znode and sometime zk-call back doesn't comeback which blocks the gc-thread forever. However, recently we added the timeout on the [object-waiting-lock](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/util/ZkUtils.java#L243-L248) which doesn't work because it's in while loop and `object.wait(timeout)` completes without any exception and GC threads keep running in while loop.\r\n\r\n3. add zk-timeout during delete ledgers in bookie else it can also block the GC thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nadd timeout while bk-gc makes zk-call to verify deleted ledgers.\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli
