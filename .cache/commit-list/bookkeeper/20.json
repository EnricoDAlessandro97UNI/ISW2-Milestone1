Currently free disk space is the only supported\nweight for a bookie. This change also introduces a new protocol message between bk client and server\ncalled GET_BOOKIE_INFO. This message is used by the client to retrieve the free disk space info from\nall the bookies. The existing placement policies: DefaultPlacementPolicy and RackAwarePlacementPolicy\nhave been enhanced to make use of the weight while selecting bookies. New test cases have been added to\ntest RackawarePlacement with weights. A new test class has been added to test the weight based selection\nalgorithm in a stand alone fashion.\n\nAuthor: Rithin <rithin.shetty@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli

handling on fetching log segments for readers\n\nThis change focuses on improving the session expire handling on fetching log segments for readers.\n\nThe log segment management in DL is now done by 3

LogSegmentMetadataCache (one per namespace instance): it is a guava cache based metadata cache. it maintains a mapping between log segment metadata path and the log segment metadata. it manages the cache for the log segments that will be accessed in this namespace instance. it doesn't manage the sequence of the log segments for streams.\n- a PerStreamLogSegmentCache for each BKLogHandler. the
