refcounting out IndexPersistenceMgr\n\nThere is a number of bugs in index persistence mgr related to how\nrefcounts are handled and how FileInfos are freed, due to the locking\nmechanism. These can result in the fencing bit being lost in ledgers,\nwhich is a serious issue. They also cause flakes in\nIndexPersistenceMgrTest#testEvictFileInfoWhenUnderlyingFileExists.\n\nFor details see the discussion at:\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/513/files/8075b0#r156676238\n\nThere are two key problems.\n\n1. FileInfos are flushed asynchronously on eviction. If another thread\ntries to read the FileInfo after the flush has been scheduled, but\nbefore it runs, it will read stale date (and we'll possibly lose the\nfence bit).\n2. FileInfos can be closed while it is still references in the\nIndexPersistenceMgr. This means that it can be fenced, but this will\nvery be flushed to disk because the FileInfo is already closed.\n\nThe patch solves this by moving FileInfo locking and refcount into a\nseparate class, FileInfoBackingCache. When either the write cache or\nread cache load a file info, it tries to load it from this backing\ncache. All writes to the the backing cache are done under a write\nlock. This class also takes care of reference counting. It hands out\nCachedFileInfo objects, which will be flushed to disk when all\nreferences are released.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Sijie

bookkeeper-server jar\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n**Problem:**\n\n`shadedArtifactAttached` was introduced in 4.6.0 to generate plain and shaded artifact for `bookkeeper-server`. Because for projects (e.g. distributedlog) that would use same protobuf and guava version as bookkeeper, they will use the plain artifact (to avoid shading protobuf/guava multiple times). However there are a few problems with that:\n\n1) bookkeeper-common is not included in the shading include set.\n2) `shadedArtifactAttached` only generate a shaded artifact (with relocated classes), but doesn't generate a dependency-reduced pom file. so you have to manually exclude relocated dependencies.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- for shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server`, include all the bookkeeper submodules that bookkeeper-server depends on. so the shaded artifact includes all the classes that need to be relocated.\n- introduce a `shaded` module for keeping new shaded libraries. Currently `bookkeeper-server-shaded` is a shaded module of `bookkeeper-server`, while `bookkeeper-server-tests-shaded` is a shaded moulde of the tests jar of `bookkeeper-server`.\n- update the client api documentation about the instructions on how to use shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server` and the new shaded module `bookkeeper-server-shaded`.\n- add test cases to verify the shaded artifact and the new shaded modules generate the right artifacts.\n\n**This change doesn't address:**\n\nCurrently both client and server are bundled in one `bookkeeper-server`. this change will not introduce any shaded client-only jar. that would be deferred until we split `bookkeeper-server` module.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #928 from sijie/fix_shading, closes #922","tree":{"sha":"635cef47ce593702df4ed5ed36641ab3f79e7676","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/635cef47ce593702df4ed5ed36641ab3f79e7676"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6"}]},{"sha":"1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0NDc4NTkyNTI2OjFmOGIyNmQ1ZjAyYWU2YmNjZjBkNTg2YmNiMTQ1ZjQ0NjFmNGZkZTY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Samuel Just","email":"sjust@salesforce.com","date":"2017-12-27T06:48:00Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2017-12-27T06:48:00Z"},"message":"ISSUE #870: ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector: harden against LM bugs\n\nThe idea behind this patch is to make it more likely that more than one\nLedgerManager bug would be required to erroneously believe a ledger to be\ndeleted.\n1) Remove the special handling for the completely empty LM.  It's not\nreally a common case nor is it much of an optimization even when it\nhappens.\n2) Add a config variable to cause the bookie to also check the\nLedgerManager.readLedgerMetadata path before actually removing a ledger.\nThe implementations of readLedgerMetadata and the iterator are\nsufficiently different that it seems worth it to have the option of\nchecking both to guard somewhat

LongHierarchicalLedgerManager: refactor to fix races\n\nLongHierarchicalLedgerRangeIterator.initialize() could erroneously exit\nwith iteratorDone if the lexicographically first path in zk had fewer\nthan 4 levels.  This can happen for a few reasons including a case where\na client creating a ledger on that path crashed during the zk updates or\nthe iterator.hasNext() call simply raced with an in-progress node\ncreation or removal.  ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector is hasNext()\nreturns false will delete all ledgers on the bookie, so this is a fairly\nserious bug.\n\nRuling out other such bugs was fairly dificult with the structure of the\ncode as written, so instead use a simpler recursive iterator design with\nsimpler pre/post conditions.\n\nAlso, surface KeeperException.NoNodeException from\nZkUtils.getChildrenInSingleNode so
