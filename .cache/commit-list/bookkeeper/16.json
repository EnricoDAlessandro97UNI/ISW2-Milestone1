force to re-insert the master key in ledger storage\n\nWhen the bookie crashes and restart, it will replay the entries from the journal. In the case of ledgers that were created, but their metadata was not flushed on disk, the ledger metadata might be lost.\n\nThis is more evident in `DbLedgerStorage`, since the ledger metadata is cached in memory and it's only inserted in the db at the checkpoint time, though it applies as well for `InterleavedLedgerStorage` where the ledger metadata was inserted in the cache but not fsynced on disk.\n\nIf the page cache content is gone, when replaying the journal content, the ledger will be tracked in memory but the bookie won't have the metadata on disk anymore.\n\nMerging from yahoo

ReadCache\n\nAdds a `ReadCache` class to be used from LedgerStorage.\n\nThe read cache is used when doing read-ahead caching after reading one entry.\n\nThe idea is that entries for the same ledger as stored in order (for each flush cycle, eg: 1min). When reading 1 entry, we expect the client to read all subsequent entries. We can then skip the RocksDb `get()` to fetch the index of the entries, by just keep reading from the entryLog, and exploiting page cache and seqeuential reads. The entries are then added to this ReadCache, where they will looked when the request for next entry comes in.\n\nThis implementation is based on dividing the memory into multiple segments.

batch rather than individually\n\nThis patch is a squash of f59b597f, 00fc5cd2, 1658eb61 & 833dc307 from the yahoo-4.3 branch. The change removes the HashWheelTimer from PerChannelBookieClient and instead runs through all outstanding ops periodically, timing them out as necessary.\n\nThe motivation for this change is to reduce the number of objects created per add/read request. With HashWheelTimer a TimerTask needs to be added to the Timer, which allocates and returns a Timeout object. We had to be careful to cancel this timeout on success.\n\nThe new approach is simpler, doesn't require any allocation per request, and doesn't require any cancellation. Functionally the end result is the same - very slow requests are timed out.\n\nThe patch also makes some additions to the original changes (due to the codebase moving since it was originally written).\n- PendingAddOps are changed to use the same mechanism for quorum timeouts.\n- The checkTimeout method is moved to the PCBCPool so we can run the check on non-connected PCBC instances. This is necessary for TLS.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\nAuthor: Siddharth Boobna <sboobna@yahoo-inc.com>\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli

channel inactive before callback\n\nThere's a race in PCBC where if the channel is errored before the\nconnection callback occurs, the channel will hang around as a zombie\nforever.\n\nThis caused a flake in\nTestDisableEnsembleChange#testRetryFailureBookie, but the problem\nitself could affect production code. This test hit it because it tries\nto reconnect in a tight loop as a bookie is booting.\n\nThe error occurs because we only change state with channelInactive if\nthe channelInactive occurred on the channel that matches the currently\nassigned this.channel. If the channel connects successfully, but\nchannelInactive occurs before the connect callback runs, the channel\nwill be closed, but the state will be transitioned to CONNECTED. No\nmore events will occur on the channel, so it'll hang around forever,\nand all requests on the channel will timeout.\n\nThe fix is to check that the channel is active before assigning it to\nthis.channel and setting state to CONNECTED. If the channel is not\nactive at this point, then the else clause of this block will run\nwhich closes the channel, and sets state to DISCONNECTED. In this\ncase, the next request will trigger a new connection attempt.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #827 from

The `Long` used for key and value are 16 bytes each and the hash-map node will take another ~24 bytes.\n\nAdditionally, all these objects are created, stored for hours and then GCed, after being tenured.\n\nBy using `ConcurrentLongLongHashMap`, we eliminate the object boxing and the need for the \"node\" since it's a open hashmap. This helps reducing a lot the memory used by the bookie when storing a large amount of entries (54 --> 16 bytes).\nAlso since we store the items in `long[]`, this will not need objects and it will not affect GC.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #821 from

It tests a race\nbetween disconnection and making a request. The flake occurred because\nwhen the disconnection happened, the request would be errorred out,\nand this would add a callback to the ordered executor. The test was\nshutting down the executor before the callback was actually run (it\nmay not even have been added in some cases), and this was causing the\nrequest to never complete, failing the

on bookie and client\n\nPart of #230, this adds checkstyle verification to the bookie and client packages in `bookkeeper-server`.\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThe changes here are primarily cosmetic, but there are also two notable changes to point out:\n\n1. In both `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.TruePredicate` and `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.EnsembleForReplacementWithNoConstraints` a `public static final` field was renamed from `instance` to `INSTANCE`. This is consistent with the use of an `INSTANCE` field in the `bookkeeper-stats` package. An alternative would be to introduce a public method `getInstance()`, but either way the checkstyle rules don't like a public constant field in lower case.\n\n2. In `UpdateLedgerOp#updateBookieIdInLedgers()`, the `throws BKException` part of the signature is problematic and prevents the checkstyle validation from completing successfully. From what I can tell, that checked exception is never thrown; as such, I have removed that from the signature. I have also removed the corresponding guard from `bookie.BookieShell`.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Coburn <acoburn@amherst.edu>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo

Checkstyle on the proto package\n\nThis is part of #230 and adds Checkstyle verification to the proto\npackage in bookeeper-server.\n\nThe changes here should generally be non-controversial, but I would like to highlight one change for particular review. In the `PerChannelBookieClient` class, there is a `public static final` field called `txnIdGenerator`. The checkstyle rules require that such public fields are ALL_CAPS. So one option would be to change that field to `TX_ID_GENERATOR` (this would be a change to the public API).\n\nThe relevant diff is here: https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/compare/master...acoburn:checkstyle_proto?expand=1#diff-e50ee2c1aec1539ea185a94605b0e550R143\n\nHowever, that field is never used outside this class, so the other option is to make the field private and keep the name as-is. (Making the field private is also a change to the public API)\n\nI chose the second option because the field seemed more like an internal field. If, however, the field should be left public, I can add a commit that changes the name to `TX_ID_GENERATOR` so that it passes the checkstyle rules.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Coburn

read request indefinitely\n\nIntegrating some changes made to Yahoo bookkeeper by Matteo Merli.\n\nThe apache bookkeeper thread pool in use by OrderedScheduler is different, and does not have access to setting a queue size limit, so I created QueueAssessibleExecutorService, and check the queue size instead.  Other than that, this code change is pretty similar to Yahoo's.\n\nOriginal bug description for this change:\n\nSince we are using a thread pool to handle read requests in bookies, we have seen that when the Bookie read IO is maxed out, the requests are being accumulated in the bookie.\n\nEssentially, the bookie is busy serving read requests that have already been timed out on the client side (end to end read latency can reach hours..). The queue keeps growing indefinitely, leading to OOM errors and bookie restart.\n\nAll unit tests pass for me locally with this change.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Gresch <agresch@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers:
