So if compaction\nkeeps failing in the middle, bookie would end up with a lot of garbage data.\n\nChange:\n1. Introduce abstract class AbstractLogCompactor with an interface compact().\n2. Move the existing compaction logic to a separate class called EntryLogCompactor.\n3. Introduce transactional compaction, we can recover an incomplete compaction or rollback a compaction failure.\n4. Add an configuration to enable transactional compaction\n\nPotential Risk:\n1. No risk if we keep using the default compactor.\n2. If we choose to enable transactional compaction with separate log file, we need to be careful about it, since we use a separate log for compaction, if we have a lot of old small ledgers in the bookie, we will end up with a lot of small entry log files. And this will potentially cause bookkeeper \"Too many open files\" because GC will scan all the entry log files and keep them open.\n\nAuthor: Yiming Zang <yzang@twitter.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico

pick a bookie from the available bookies in the cluster to satisfy the placement constraint. (#596)\n2. hence, remove `targetBookie` from ReplicationWorker, because the parameter will volatile the placement constraint. (#583)\n3. at the same time, change `LedgerFragement` to represent the number of bookies that need to be check and replicate. a) the ledger checker can use the correct bookie index for verifying the existence of entries in a bookie (for stripping case) b) only read entries one time when need to replicate them to multiple bookies.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly
