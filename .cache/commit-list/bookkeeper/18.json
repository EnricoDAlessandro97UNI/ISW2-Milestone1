Multi* based classes. A lot of unit tests unnecessarily extended from those base classes. Converted them to extend BookKeeperClusterTestCase directly. Confirmed this with sijie\n- Reduce sleep period for some test cases\n\nLedgerEntry fixes for #317\n- use checkState rather than checkNull to keep the behavior consistent as before\n- fix BookKeeperTest#testReadEntryReleaseByteBufs\n\nTestBackwardCompat:\n- removed testCompact400 (400 has been very long time ago, no one is running 400)\n- BookKeeperNettyServer should shut down netty server when failed to construct a bookie\n\nTestDiskChecker:\n- increased the threshold to 0.99f. be consistent with TestBKConfiguration\n\nBookieInitializationTest\n- make each test method using

BookieInfoReader and fix associated test flappers\n\nBookieInfoReader:\n\nThe previous syncronization logic wasn't really correct, and the logic\nat the top of the method was far more complicated than it needed to be.\nRestrict bookies to be non-null.  Restructure the code to simply use\nthe BookieInfoReader instance as a single lock.\n\nOne significant behavioral change is that we scan every bookie not in\nthe map, and we clear from the map bookies which returned an error.\n\nAlso, explicitely cache the most recent bookie set reported by the\nBookieWatcher.  This eliminates the need to call into BookieWatcher\nfrom getReadWriteBookieInfo and the corresponding error path.  The\nperiodic scan continues to explicitely check.\n\nAnother departure is the addition of an explicit retry-on-error param to\ntrigger retry if any of the requests failed\n(getBookieInfoRetryIntervalSeconds).  We'll only retry the ones that\nactually failed (along with any new additions since the last run).  This\nis useful because bookie startup triggers the addition of the bookie\nnode to zk before the bookie actually becomes available for the bookie\ninfo request, so there can be rare races in the unit tests between\nBookieInfoReader requesting the info and the bookie actually being up.\n\nAlso, add a method to allow tests to wait for updates to be reflected.\n\nPerChannelBookieClient: fix error handling for BookieInfo keys\n\nPassing a key corresponding to a GET_BOOKIE_INFO operation to\nerrorOutReadKey results in a casting exception, clean up the invalid\ncalls.\n\nBookKeeperClusterTestCase: add killBookieAndWaitForZK\n\nShould reduce the need for tests to wait for an arbitrary period to let\nthe cluster \"settle\".\n\nBookKeeperDiskSpaceWeightedLedgerPlacementTest:\n\nThis test was heavily time dependent, and the Thread.sleep values did\nnot work universally.  Instead, eliminate the arbitrary Thread.sleep\nvalues and instead verify the free space changes on each change.\n\nAlso, switch the delay on\ntestDiskSpaceWeightedBookieSelectionWithPeriodicBookieInfoUpdate\nto simply use an atomic boolean to signal the value switch.\n\nSigned-off-by: Samuel Just <sjustsalesforce.com>\n\nAuthor: Samuel
