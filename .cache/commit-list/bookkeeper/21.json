maps and sets for primitive types\n\nIn BookKeeper there are many instances of maps and sets that use ledger id\nand entry ids as keys or values. JDK concurrent collections have the overhead\nof boxing all the primitive values into objects (eg: long --> Long) that would\nneed to be allocated from the heap. In addition to that, JDK map implementations\nare closed hash tables and they will require at least one more allocation to hold\nthe linked-list/tree node.\n\nThere are already available libraries that offer primitive collections with\nzero-allocation, but none of these support concurrent maps/sets.\n\nWe have added a handful of specializations, all based on the same implementation\nidea. We have a hash table which is broken down into multiple sections. Each\nsections, on its own, is an open hash table with linear probing, protected by\na stamped lock.\n\nAll insertions, lookups and iterations on these collections are allocation free.\n\n```\nConcurrentLongHashMap: Map<long, Object>\nConcurrentLongHashSet: Set<long>\nConcurrentLongLongHashMap: Map<long, long>\nConcurrentLongLongPairHashMap: Map< Pair<long, long>, Pair<long,

down for upgrade or even if it looses zk connection\nintermittently, the auditor detects it as a lost bookie and starts under replication detection and\nthe replication workers on other bookie nodes start replicating the under replicated ledgers. All\nof this stops once the bookie comes up but by then a few ledgers would get replicated. Given the\nfact that we have multiple copies of data, it is probably not necessary to start the recovery as\nsoon as a bookie goes down. We can wait for an hour or so and then start recovery. This should\ncover cases like planned upgrade, intermittent network connectivity loss, etc.\n\nThis change:\n    1) Provides a bookie option 'lostBookieRecoveryDelay' in secs, which when set to a non zero value,\n       will delay the start of recovery by that number of seconds. By default, this option is set to 0;\n       which means the audit is not delayed.\n    2) If another bookie were to go down in this interval, the recovery is immediately started and the\n       one scheduled for future is canceled.\n    3) Adds counters to track how many audits were delayed(#1) and how many scheduled audits were\n       canceled due to multiple bookie failures(#2).\n    4) Three junit tests to verify the new feature.\n\nAuthor: Rithin <rithin.shetty@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: siddharth.boobna@gmail.com <siddharth.boobna@gmail.com>, Enrico Olivelli
