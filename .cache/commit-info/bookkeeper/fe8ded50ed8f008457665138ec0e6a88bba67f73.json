I presume that compiler could strip them out but the code is less readable. (Just note that 'x & true == x').\n\nRemoved useless assignments.\n\nAuthor: Diego Salvi <lothruin.mirwen@gmail.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #215 from diegosalvi/master, closes #216","tree":{"sha":"f2e0765f752f68b1e5cd43f886b4bdf3e4c055ae","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/trees/f2e0765f752f68b1e5cd43f886b4bdf3e4c055ae"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/git/commits/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73/comments","author":{"login":"diegosalvi","id":3481209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODEyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3481209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi","html_url":"https://github.com/diegosalvi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"189d7e80b4b0096d580bafa66323fa5f099df65d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commits/189d7e80b4b0096d580bafa66323fa5f099df65d","html_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/commit/189d7e80b4b0096d580bafa66323fa5f099df65d"}],"stats":{"total":4,"additions":0,"deletions":4},"files":[{"sha":"9e7d034d6a83d68be8f2876f91927242364ac824","filename":"bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/replication/Auditor.java","status":"modified","additions":0,"deletions":4,"changes":4,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/blob/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73/bookkeeper-server%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fbookkeeper%2Freplication%2FAuditor.java","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/raw/fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73/bookkeeper-server%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fbookkeeper%2Freplication%2FAuditor.java","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/bookkeeper/contents/bookkeeper-server%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fbookkeeper%2Freplication%2FAuditor.java?ref=fe8ded50ed8f008457665138ec0e6a88bba67f73","patch":"@@ -370,17 +370,13 @@ private void startAudit(boolean shutDownTask) {\n             shutDownTask = false;\n         } catch (BKException bke) {\n             LOG.error(\"Exception getting bookie list\", bke);\n-            shutDownTask &= true;\n         } catch (InterruptedException ie) {\n             Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n             LOG.error(\"Interrupted while watching available bookies \", ie);\n-            shutDownTask &= true;\n         } catch (BKAuditException bke) {\n             LOG.error(\"Exception while watching available bookies\", bke);\n-            shutDownTask &= true;\n         } catch (KeeperException ke) {\n             LOG.error(\"Exception reading bookie list\", ke);\n-            shutDownTask &= true;\n         }\n         if (shutDownTask) {\n             submitShutdownTask();"}]}
