Each version will be given a\n+distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n+Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n+right to modify this License.\n+\n+4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n+\n+You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n+notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n+distributed or otherwise made available under any\n+subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n+use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n+available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n+License published by the license steward.\n+\n+4.3. Modified Versions.\n+\n+When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n+new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n+use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n+the license and remove any references to the name of the\n+license steward (except to note that the license differs\n+from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n+the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n+\n+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n+\n+COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n+INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n+SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n+COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n+WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n+ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n+DISCLAIMER.\n+\n+6. TERMINATION.\n+\n+6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n+terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n+herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n+becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n+nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n+this License shall survive.\n+\n+6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n+declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n+a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n+whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n+alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n+Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n+or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n+Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n+patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n+indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n+Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n+and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n+License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n+terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n+of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n+period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n+Participant Software against such Participant either\n+unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n+Participant.\n+\n+6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n+above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n+by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n+(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n+shall survive termination.\n+\n+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n+\n+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n+(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n+COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n+LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n+LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n+STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n+COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n+INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n+LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n+INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n+APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n+NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n+APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n+\n+The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n+defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n+computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n+252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n+documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n+1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n+through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n+acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n+This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n+any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n+Government rights in computer software under this License.\n+\n+9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n+\n+This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n+extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n+governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n+contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n+applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n+jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n+relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n+the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n+notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n+party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n+costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n+International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n+regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n+be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n+You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n+United States export administration regulations (and the export\n+control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n+distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n+\n+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n+\n+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n+indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n+and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n+distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n+herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n+of liability.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For javax.annotation-api (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250):\n+This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For javax.ws.rs-api (https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/):\n+This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Joda Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n+This is licensed under the BSD license:\n+\n+Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n+modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n+CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n+documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n+\n+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n+\n+i) changes to the Program, and\n+\n+ii) additions to the Program;\n+\n+where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n+distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\n+Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\n+acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\n+the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n+conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\n+derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+\n+a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n+distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\n+derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+\n+b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\n+Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n+Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n+This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n+Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n+addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n+Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n+which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+\n+c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n+property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n+Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n+intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n+rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n+responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n+For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n+distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+before distributing the Program.\n+\n+d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n+forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n+own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+\n+b) its license agreement:\n+\n+i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n+conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n+non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n+fitness for a particular purpose;\n+\n+ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n+damages, such as lost profits;\n+\n+iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n+by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+\n+iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n+through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+\n+b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+\n+Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n+Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n+a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n+and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n+actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n+extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n+connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n+offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n+relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n+to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n+Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n+control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n+any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n+Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n+related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n+Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n+requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n+Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n+distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\n+rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n+program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n+programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n+STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n+OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n+GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n+law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n+terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n+provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n+provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n+a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n+lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n+under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n+addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n+itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n+Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n+survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n+No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n+IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n+as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n+Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n+under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n+is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n+Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n+2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n+intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n+expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n+expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose.

GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n+Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose.
