On the other hand, many software have unorthodox implementation so you could done a samething with\n+both of them.\n+However, in general as suggested by their name, the access management basically handles the access in a certain \n+environment providing some kind of credentials; on the countray the identity management handles the digital identity \n+profile and its life cicle. \n+Apache Syncope is an identity manager.\n+\n+=== Identity Stores\n+An identity store is the place where the digital identity are stored. Of course there are various store types, the most \n+famous are:\n+\n+* Microsoft Active Directory;\n+* LDAP\n+** OpenLDAP;\n+** FreeIPA;\n+** ForgeRock OpenDJ;\n+** 389 Directory Server;\n+* DBMS\n+** MySQL\n+** PostgreSQL\n+** Oracle\n+* ...\n+\n+From Apache Syncope point of view, an identity stores is viewed as an integrated resource with a communication based\n+on the identity connectors.\n+\n+=== Provisioning Engines\n+A provisioning engine is a software able to execute some operation on the profile of a digital identity. \n+Precisely this operation could be run to manage a user life cicle, the _CRUD_ operation to persiste the user on an \n+identity store:\n+\n+* Create\n+* Read\n+* Update\n+* Delete\n+\n+or could be the operations albe to modify the user profile in order to activate or deactivate its digital identity, or\n+could be the operations to add or remove a role from an user profile to achieve the RBAC (Role-based access control)\n+in an enviroment and so on. Definitely a provisioning angine manages the digital identity user profile in a centralized\n+way.\n+\n+=== Access Managers\n+As briefly mentioned before, an access manager is not an identity manager. An access management software manages above all\n+the authentication on a given environment. It provides the methods, generally called authentication module, to manage \n+the user authentication, the latter based on various identification system as the password, the fingerprint or based on \n+various protocols as SAML and OAuth 2.0.\n+\n+=== The Complete Picture\n\\ No newline at end of file"},{"sha":"250e87f481c0c75ea2944d6d9438e1fc9250b0c0","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/reference-guide.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":9,"changes":10,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/8f1a5571600310becf7722c4500684581ee61a1b/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/8f1a5571600310becf7722c4500684581ee61a1b/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc?ref=8f1a5571600310becf7722c4500684581ee61a1b","patch":"@@ -54,15 +54,7 @@ provisioning, and compliance.\n \n include::introduction/introduction.adoc[]\n \n-== Identity and Access Management\n-\n-=== Identity Stores\n-\n-=== Provisioning Engines\n-\n-=== Access Managers\n-\n-=== The Complete Picture\n+include::iam/iam.adoc[]\n \n == Architecture\n "}]}
