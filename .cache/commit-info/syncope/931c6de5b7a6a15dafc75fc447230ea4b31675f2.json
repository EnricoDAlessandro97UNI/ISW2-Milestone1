IdM involves considering user attributes, roles, resources and entitlements in trying to give a decent \n+answer to the question bumping up every time in an IT administrator's mind:\n+\n+[.text-center]\n+_Who has access to What, When, How, and Why?_ \n+\n+=== What is this Identity Management, anyway?\n+\n+****\n+Account:: Computers work with records of data about persons. Such records contains technical information needed by the system for \n+which the account is created and managed.\n+(Digital) Identity:: A representation of a set of claims made by one digital subject about itself. *It's you!*\n+****\n+\n+Have you ever been hired by a company, entered an organization or just subscribed a new Google account?\n+Companies, organizations and cloud entities works with applications that need your data to function properly: \n+username, password, e-mail, first name, surname, and more.\n+\n+Who is going to feed such information? And what happens when you need to be enabled for more applications? And what if\n+you get promoted and acquire more rights on the applications you already had access to?\n+Most important, what happens when you quit or they gently let you go?\n+\n+Shortly, Identity Management takes care of managing identity data throughout what is called the *Identity Lifecycle*.\n+\n+[.text-center]\n+image::identityLifecycle.png[title=\"Identity Lifecycle\",alt=\"Identity Lifecycle\",width=\"505\",height=\"324\"]\n+\n+.Users, groups and any objects\n+****\n+With Apache Syncope 2.0.0, the managed identities are not limited anymore to users and groups. New object types can be\n+defined so that any object's data can be managed through Syncope: workstations, printers, folders, sensors, services,\n+and so on. This positions Apache Syncope at best places for bringing Identity Management in the IoT world.\n+****\n+\n+=== Bird's eye view on Architecture\n+\n+*_Core_* is the central component, providing all services offered by Apache Syncope. +\n+It exposes a full-compliant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services[JAX-RS 2.0^] \n+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[RESTful^] interface which enables third-party applications,\n+written in any programming language, to consume IdM services.\n+\n+ * *_Logic_* implements the overall business logic that can be triggered via REST services, and controls some additional\n+features (notifications, reports and audit over all)\n+ * *_Provisioning_* is delegated to manage the internal (via workflow) and external (via specific connectors) \n+representation of users, groups and any objects. +\n+Being the crucial decision point for defining and enforcing the consistency and transformations between internal and\n+external data, this component needs often to be tailored on requirements of specific deployment. For this reason, besides\n+the all-Java default implementation that can be anyway extended, an http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel^]-based \n+implementation is also available as extension, which brings all the power of runtime changes and adaptation.\n+ * *_Workflow_*  is one of pluggable aspects: this lets every deployment choose the preferred engine\n+among provided - including the one based on http://www.activiti.org/[Activiti BPM^], the reference open source \n+http://www.bpmn.org/[BPMN 2.0^] implementation - or define new, custom ones. \n+ * *_Persistence_* manages all data (users, groups, attributes, resources, ...) at high level \n+using a standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA 2.0^] approach, persisting to an underlying \n+database, referred as the *_Internal Storage_*. Consistency is ensured via the comprehensive\n+http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html[transaction management^] \n+provided by the Spring Framework. +\n+Globally, all this permits to scale up to million entities and at the same time allows great portability with no code \n+changes: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MS SQL Server are fully supported deployment options.\n+ * *_Security_* defines a fine-grained set of entitlements which can be granted to administrators, thus allowing to\n+implement real delegated administration scenarios.\n+\n+[.text-center]\n+image::architecture.png[title=\"Architecture\",alt=\"Architecture\"]\n+\n+*_Admin UI_* is the web-based console for configuring and administering running deployments, with full support\n+for delegated administration.\n+\n+*_End-user UI_* is the web-based application for self-registration, self-service and password reset.\n+\n+*_CLI_* is the command-line application for interacting with Apache Syncope from scripts, particularly useful for \n+system administrators.\n+\n+Third-party applications are provided full access to IdM services by leveraging the REST interface, either via the \n+Java _SyncopeClient_ library (at the basis of Admin UI, End-user UI and CLI) or plain HTTP calls.\n+\n+.ConnId\n+****\n+The *_Provisioning_* layer relays on http://connid.tirasa.net[ConnId^]; ConnId is designed to separate the \n+implementation of an application from the dependencies of the system that the application is attempting to connect to.\n+\n+ConnId is the continuation of The Identity Connectors Framework (Sun ICF), a project that used to be part of market \n+leader Sun IdM and has since been released by Sun Microsystems as an Open Source project. This makes the connectors layer\n+particularly reliable because most connectors have already been implemented in the framework and widely tested.\n+\n+The new ConnId project, featuring contributors from several companies, provides all that is required nowadays for a \n+modern Open Source project, including an Apache Maven driven build, artifacts and mailing lists. Additional connectors –\n+such as for SOAP, CSV, PowerShell and Active Directory – are also provided. \n+****\n\\ No newline at end of file"},{"sha":"869ef47ef84fce2483039d2cc34b389aebd554a7","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/getting-started/systemRequirements.adoc","status":"added","additions":50,"deletions":0,"changes":50,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/931c6de5b7a6a15dafc75fc447230ea4b31675f2/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fgetting-started%2FsystemRequirements.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/931c6de5b7a6a15dafc75fc447230ea4b31675f2/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fgetting-started%2FsystemRequirements.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fgetting-started%2FsystemRequirements.adoc?ref=931c6de5b7a6a15dafc75fc447230ea4b31675f2","patch":"@@ -0,0 +1,50 @@\n+//\n+// Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+// or more contributor license agreements.
