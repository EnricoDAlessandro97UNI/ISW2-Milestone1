The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n-which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-\n-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n-Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-before distributing the Program.\n-\n-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n-forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n-own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) its license agreement:\n-\n-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n-non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n-fitness for a particular purpose;\n-\n-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n-damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n-by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-\n-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n-through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-\n-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n-Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n-and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n-control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n-any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n-Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n-OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n-provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n-a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n-lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n-under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n-addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n-itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n-Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n-survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n-IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n-as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n-Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n-under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n-is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n-2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n-intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n-expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n-expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n-any resulting litigation."},{"sha":"f8ec977d223c78730643b1e2b2f033c2be3f8f49","filename":"client/cli/NOTICE","status":"modified","additions":0,"deletions":6,"changes":6,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2/client%2Fcli%2FNOTICE","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2/client%2Fcli%2FNOTICE","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/client%2Fcli%2FNOTICE?ref=bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2","patch":"@@ -55,12 +55,6 @@ Copyright (c) 2014 The JASYPT team.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-\n-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n-reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n-distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\n-derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-\n-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\n-Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n-This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n-addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n-Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n-which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-\n-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n-Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-before distributing the Program.\n-\n-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n-forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n-own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) its license agreement:\n-\n-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n-non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n-fitness for a particular purpose;\n-\n-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n-damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n-by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-\n-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n-through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-\n-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n-Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n-and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n-control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n-any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n-Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n-provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n-a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n-lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n-under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n-addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n-itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n-Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n-survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n-IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n-as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n-Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n-under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n-is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n-2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n-intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n-expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n-expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n-intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

A Contribution 'originates' from a\n-Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\n-acting on such Contributor's behalf.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-\n-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n-reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n-distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\n-derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-\n-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\n-Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n-This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n-addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n-Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n-which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-\n-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n-Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-before distributing the Program.\n-\n-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n-forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n-own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) its license agreement:\n-\n-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n-non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n-fitness for a particular purpose;\n-\n-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n-damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n-by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-\n-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n-through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-\n-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-\n-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n-Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n-and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n-control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n-any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n-Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\n-rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n-program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n-programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n-OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n-provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n-a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n-lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n-under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n-addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n-itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n-Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n-survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n-IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n-as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n-Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n-under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n-is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n-2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n-intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n-expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n-expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n-any resulting litigation.\n-\n-==\n-\n For X-editable (http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/):\n This is licensed under the MIT license, see above."},{"sha":"0766d392f7d1822f55fa4806adb35502f1476466","filename":"standalone/NOTICE","status":"modified","additions":0,"deletions":6,"changes":6,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2/standalone%2FNOTICE","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2/standalone%2FNOTICE","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/standalone%2FNOTICE?ref=bf87c856d4d829b7b2141c8116eab1af2f06fee2","patch":"@@ -199,12 +199,6 @@ This product includes software developed by the MyBatis project.\n \n ==\n \n-This product includes software developed by the ASM project.\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 INRIA, France Telecom\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-==\n-\n This product includes software developed by Terracotta.
