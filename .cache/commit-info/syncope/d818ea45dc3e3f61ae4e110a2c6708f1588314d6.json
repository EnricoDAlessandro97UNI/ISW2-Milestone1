That agent may be a person, \n+organisation, or device. The information in digital identities is used by computers to make decisions about how to \n+interact with external agents. It allows a computer to answer two basic questions:\n+\n+With which external agent is it interacting?\n+Has it interacted with an external agent in the past?\n+The information contained in a digital identity allows these questions to be answered without the involvement of human \n+operators. Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it \n+possible for computers to mediate relationships.\n+\n+The term \"digital identity\" has also come to denote aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the \n+widespread use of identity information to represent people in computer systems.\n+\n+Digital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to \n+their civil, or national, identities. Furthermore, the use of digital identities is now so widespread that many \n+discussions refer to \"digital identity\" as the entire collection of information generated by a personâ€™s online activity. \n+Especially where that information is publicly available, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. \n+In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social, identity. This may also referred \n+to as an online identity.\n+****"},{"sha":"2f7113cc674fb329b789ffbfec9d6ce4be84b986","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/introduction/introduction.adoc","status":"modified","additions":2,"deletions":0,"changes":2,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/d818ea45dc3e3f61ae4e110a2c6708f1588314d6/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fintroduction%2Fintroduction.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/d818ea45dc3e3f61ae4e110a2c6708f1588314d6/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fintroduction%2Fintroduction.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fintroduction%2Fintroduction.adoc?ref=d818ea45dc3e3f61ae4e110a2c6708f1588314d6","patch":"@@ -23,6 +23,8 @@ Java EE technology and released under the Apache 2.0 license.\n \n include::opensource.adoc[]\n \n+include::digitalidentity.adoc[]\n+\n include::history.adoc[]\n \n include::followus.adoc[]\n\\ No newline at end of file"}]}
