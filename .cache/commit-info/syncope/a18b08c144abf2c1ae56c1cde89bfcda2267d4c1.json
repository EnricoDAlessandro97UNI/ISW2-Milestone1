Only required if either:\n+** the value for \"*adminPasswordAlgorithm*\" is \"AES\" or\n+** the configuration parameter \"password.cipher.algorithm\" is changed to \"AES\" (See section 4.6.12 \"Configuration Parameters\" of\n+the Reference Guide for more information).\n+* *anonymousKey* - The key value to use for anonymous requests.\n+* *jwsKey* - The symmetric signing key used to sign access tokens (Syncope 2.0.3 onwards only). See section 4.4.1 \"REST Authentication and \n+Authorization\" of the Reference Guide for more information.\n+\n+Note that if you installed Syncope using either the installer or the maven archetype methods, then you will have already\n+supplied custom values for \"*secretKey*\" and \"*anonymousKey*\". From Syncope 2.0.4 onwards, both installation methods will also\n+query for \"*jwsKey*\", meaning that only the \"*adminPassword*\" must be changed for these installation methods."}]}
