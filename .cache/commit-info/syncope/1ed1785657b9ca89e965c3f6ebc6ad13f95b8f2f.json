Hence, security is mostly implemented and enforced by the core, as the console is basically an external REST \n+client (check High-level Architecture for more details).\n+\n+===== Entitlements\n+Authentication and authorization in Syncope is fundamentally based on Entitlements. \n+Entitlements are basically strings describing the right to perform an operation.\n+Defaults entitlements are included at the end of content.xml and always loaded into internal storage.\n+Entitlements can only be assigned to roles: this is the basis of a role-based authorization mechanism.\n+\n+* Normal entitlements::\n+related to the general operations that can be performed (like as TASK_DELETE or CONNECTOR_UPDATE);\n+* Role operational entitlements::\n+specifically bound to each and every role defined (like as ROLE_10 or ROLE_23).\n+\n+Why such distinction is needed? Because Syncope implements a delegated role-based authorization model so that an user \n+can manage other users and this can be specified with a very fine-grained mechanism.\n+\n+===== Role ownership\n+Starting with Syncope 1.1.0, the role owner concept is introduced: an user or a role can be defined as owner of a given \n+role.\n+Users owning a role (or user assigned to a role owning a role) are granted to perform any operation on owned role and \n+also assigned any role operational entitlement of owned role.\n+This means that if such owners are also granted some user-related entitlements (like as USER_CREATE or USER_UPDATE), \n+then they will be entitled to administer users of owned role as well.\n+\n+===== Example\n+Let's suppose that we want to implement the following scenario:\n+_Administrator A can create users under role 5 but not under role 7, administrator B can update users under role 6 and 8, \n+administrator C can update role 8._\n+In this scenario, Syncope will have defined at least the following entitlements:\n+\n+* USER_CREATE, USER_UPDATE, ROLE_UPDATE\n+* ROLE_5, ROLE_6, ROLE_7, ROLE_8\n+\n+Here it follows how entitlements should be assigned to administrators in order to implement the scenario above:\n+\n+* A: USER_CREATE + ROLE_5\n+* B: USER_UPDATE + ROLE_6 + ROLE_8\n+* C: ROLE_UPDATE + ROLE_8\n+\n+With role ownership, if administrator D is set as owner of role 8, the following entitlements will be automatically \n+granted:\n+\n+* D: ROLE_READ + ROLE_CREATE + ROLE_UPDATE + ROLE_DELETE + ROLE_8\n+\n+===== Root administrator\n+There is of course a special admin user, granted by all the entitlements defined in the system, thus capable of \n+performing any available operation.\n\\ No newline at end of file"},{"sha":"80e7f745724b144db11fca1d1ed516aa4b3bfaee","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/iam/iam.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":1,"changes":2,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/1ed1785657b9ca89e965c3f6ebc6ad13f95b8f2f/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fiam%2Fiam.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/1ed1785657b9ca89e965c3f6ebc6ad13f95b8f2f/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fiam%2Fiam.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fiam%2Fiam.adoc?ref=1ed1785657b9ca89e965c3f6ebc6ad13f95b8f2f","patch":"@@ -31,6 +31,6 @@ include::identitystores.adoc[]\n \n include::provisioningengines.adoc[]\n \n-include::accessmanager.adoc[]\n+include::accessmanager/accessmanager.adoc[]\n \n include::thecompletepicture.adoc[]\n\\ No newline at end of file"}]}
