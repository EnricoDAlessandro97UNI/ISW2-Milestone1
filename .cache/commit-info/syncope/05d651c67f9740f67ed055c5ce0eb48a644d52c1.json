A Contribution 'originates' from a\n+Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\n+acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\n+the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n+conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\n+derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2.

While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n+a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n+and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n+actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n+extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n+connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n+offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n+relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n+to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n+Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n+control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n+any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n+Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n+related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n+Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n+requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n+Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n+distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\n+rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n+program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n+programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n+STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n+OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n+GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n+law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n+terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n+provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n+provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n+a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n+lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n+under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n+addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n+itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n+Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n+survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n+No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n+IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n+as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n+Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n+under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n+is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n+Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n+2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n+intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n+expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n+expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n+any resulting litigation."},{"sha":"e13c0f97210a65b12d13f64dcb17a214eacf4c10","filename":"docker/wa/NOTICE","status":"modified","additions":217,"deletions":23,"changes":240,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/05d651c67f9740f67ed055c5ce0eb48a644d52c1/docker%2Fwa%2FNOTICE","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/05d651c67f9740f67ed055c5ce0eb48a644d52c1/docker%2Fwa%2FNOTICE","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/docker%2Fwa%2FNOTICE?ref=05d651c67f9740f67ed055c5ce0eb48a644d52c1","patch":"@@ -57,11 +57,6 @@ Copyright (c) 2010 Pablo Fernandez\n \n ==\n \n-This product includes software developed by the Gson project.\n-Copyright (c) 2008 Google Inc.\n-\n-==\n-\n This product includes software developed by Error Prone.\n \n ==\n@@ -120,16 +115,6 @@ Copyright (c) 2022 Square, Inc.\n \n ==\n \n-This product includes software developed by Okio\n-Copyright 2013 Square, Inc.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by Retrofit\n-Copyright 2014 Square, Inc.\n-\n-==\n-\n This product includes software developed by Retrofit\n Copyright 2014 Square, Inc.\n \n@@ -171,6 +156,10 @@ Copyright (c) 2014-2018, Yubico AB\n \n ==\n \n+This product includes software developed by the HikariCP project.\n+\n+==\n+\n This product includes software developed by Dough Lea\n \n ==\n@@ -205,6 +194,16 @@ Copyright (C) 2009-2016 Kristopher Michael Kowal and contributors\n \n ==\n \n+This product includes software developed by HAL Explorer\n+Copyright (c) 2022 Kai Toedter <kai@toedter.com>\n+\n+==\n+\n+This product includes the Javascript syntax highlighter.\n+Copyright (c) 2006, Ivan Sagalaev\n+\n+==\n+\n This product includes software developed by the Metrics project.\n Copyright (c) 2010-2014 Coda Hale, Yammer.com\n \n@@ -230,12 +229,12 @@ Copyright 2016 SmartBear Software\n \n ==\n \n-This product includes software developed by Userinfo.io\n-Copyright (c) 2014 Vincent DURMONT <vdurmont@gmail.com>\n+This product includes software produced and maintained by Jakarta Annotations\n+All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.\n \n ==\n \n-This product includes software produced and maintained by Jakarta Annotations\n+This product includes software produced and maintained by the Jakarta WebSocket project.\n All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.\n \n ==\n@@ -246,6 +245,11 @@ All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.
