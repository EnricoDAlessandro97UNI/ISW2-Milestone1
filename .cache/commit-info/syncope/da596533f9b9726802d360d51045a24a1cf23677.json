And, in reality, now that Open Source is quite a brand, what really does it mean?\n+\n+To answer to this question maybe it's better to refer to the words of the https://opensource.org[Open Source Initiave]\n+about _the open source definition_:\n+\n+Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must \n+comply with the following criteria:\n+\n+*1. Free Redistribution*::\n+The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate \n+software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty \n+or other fee for such sale.\n+*2. Source Code*::\n+The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where \n+some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the \n+source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. \n+The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated \n+source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.\n+*3. Derived Works*::\n+The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the \n+same terms as the license of the original software.\n+*4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code*::\n+The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the \n+distribution of \"patch files\" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. \n+The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require \n+derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.\n+*5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups*::\n+The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n+*6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor*::\n+The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. \n+For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n+*7. Distribution of License*::\n+The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for \n+execution of an additional license by those parties.\n+*8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product*::\n+The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. \n+If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, \n+all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction \n+with the original software distribution.\n+*9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software*::\n+The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. \n+For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source \n+software.\n+*10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral*::\n+No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\n+\n+This introduction about the Open Source because, as mentioned before, there are many software defined Open Source but\n+more than anyone doesn't compy with the list before. On the contrary Apache Syncope is a real Open Source software\n+because it is compliant with Open Source criteria.\n+\n+include::history.adoc[]\n\\ No newline at end of file"},{"sha":"82e50ad657a88f47d1e7cfa4e7f599ef518a5b36","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/reference-guide.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":3,"changes":4,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/da596533f9b9726802d360d51045a24a1cf23677/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/da596533f9b9726802d360d51045a24a1cf23677/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide.adoc?ref=da596533f9b9726802d360d51045a24a1cf23677","patch":"@@ -52,9 +52,7 @@ New contributors are always welcome!\n This reference guide covers Apache Syncope services for identity management,\n provisioning, and compliance.\n \n-== Introduction\n-\n-=== A bit of history\n+include::introduction/introduction.adoc[]\n \n == Identity and Access Management\n "}]}
