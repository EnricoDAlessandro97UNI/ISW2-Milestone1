Availability of Source Code.\n+\n+Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n+available in Executable form must also be made available in\n+Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n+distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n+include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n+Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n+otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n+such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n+obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n+reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n+for software exchange.\n+\n+3.2. Modifications.\n+\n+The Modifications that You create or to which You\n+contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\n+represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\n+original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to\n+grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n+\n+3.3. Required Notices.\n+\n+You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\n+that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\n+You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n+trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\n+any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n+attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n+\n+3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n+\n+You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n+Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n+applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n+rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n+fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n+obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n+However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n+behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n+must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n+support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n+Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n+by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n+warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n+\n+3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n+\n+You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\n+Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\n+of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n+different from this License, provided that You are in\n+compliance with the terms of this License and that the\n+license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\n+or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\n+from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n+distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n+different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n+any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n+alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You\n+hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n+Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n+Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\n+You offer.\n+\n+3.6. Larger Works.\n+\n+You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software\n+with other code not governed by the terms of this License\n+and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\n+a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\n+are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n+\n+4. Versions of the License.\n+\n+4.1. New Versions.\n+\n+Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and\n+may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n+from time to time. Each version will be given a\n+distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n+Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n+right to modify this License.\n+\n+4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n+\n+You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n+notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n+distributed or otherwise made available under any\n+subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n+use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n+available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n+License published by the license steward.\n+\n+4.3. Modified Versions.\n+\n+When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n+new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n+use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n+the license and remove any references to the name of the\n+license steward (except to note that the license differs\n+from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n+the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n+\n+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n+\n+COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n+INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n+SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n+COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n+WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n+ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n+DISCLAIMER.\n+\n+6. TERMINATION.\n+\n+6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n+terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n+herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n+becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n+nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n+this License shall survive.\n+\n+6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n+declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n+a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n+whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n+alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n+Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n+or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n+Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n+patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n+indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n+Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n+and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n+License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n+terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n+of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n+period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n+Participant Software against such Participant either\n+unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n+Participant.\n+\n+6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n+above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n+by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n+(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n+shall survive termination.\n+\n+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n+\n+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n+(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n+COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n+LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n+LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n+STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n+COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n+INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n+LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n+INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n+APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n+NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n+APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n+\n+The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n+defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n+computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n+252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n+documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n+1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n+through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n+acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n+This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n+any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n+Government rights in computer software under this License.\n+\n+9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n+\n+This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n+extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n+governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n+contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n+applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n+jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n+relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n+the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n+notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n+party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n+costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n+International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n+regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n+be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n+You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n+United States export administration regulations (and the export\n+control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n+distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n+\n+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n+\n+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n+indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n+and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n+distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n+herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n+of liability.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For AOP Alliance (http://aopalliance.sourceforge.net/):\n+This is Public Domain.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For ASM (http://asm.ow2.org/):\n+This is licensed under the BSD license.\n+\n+Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted \n+provided that the following conditions are met:\n+\n+ * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of \n+   conditions and the following disclaimer.\n+ * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of \n+   conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials \n+   provided with the distribution.\n+ * Neither the name of the author nor the names of its contributors may be used to \n+   endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written \n+   permission. \n+\n+THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY \n+EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF \n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
