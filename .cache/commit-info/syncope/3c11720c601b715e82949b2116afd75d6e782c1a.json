A Contribution 'originates' from a\n+Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\n+acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\n+the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n+conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\n+derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+\n+a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n+distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\n+derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+\n+b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\n+Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n+Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n+This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n+Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n+addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n+Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n+which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+\n+c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n+property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n+Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n+intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n+rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n+responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n+For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n+distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+before distributing the Program.\n+\n+d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n+forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n+own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+\n+b) its license agreement:\n+\n+i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n+conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n+non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n+fitness for a particular purpose;\n+\n+ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n+damages, such as lost profits;\n+\n+iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n+by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+\n+iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n+through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+\n+b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+\n+Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n+Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n+a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\n+and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n+actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n+extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n+connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n+offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n+relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n+to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n+Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n+control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n+any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n+Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n+related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n+Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n+requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n+Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n+distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\n+rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n+program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n+programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n+STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n+OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n+GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n+law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n+terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n+provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n+provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n+a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n+lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n+under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n+addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n+itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n+Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n+survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n+No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n+IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n+as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n+Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n+under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n+is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n+Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n+2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n+intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n+expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n+expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n+any resulting litigation.\n+\n+==\n+\n For X-editable (http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/):\n This is licensed under the MIT license, see above."},{"sha":"025bddef8d9ab8caa1e9c5df01fda2e9284b9729","filename":"standalone/NOTICE","status":"modified","additions":50,"deletions":20,"changes":70,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/3c11720c601b715e82949b2116afd75d6e782c1a/standalone%2FNOTICE","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/3c11720c601b715e82949b2116afd75d6e782c1a/standalone%2FNOTICE","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/standalone%2FNOTICE?ref=3c11720c601b715e82949b2116afd75d6e782c1a","patch":"@@ -10,12 +10,7 @@ with which this file is now or was at one time distributed.\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the AngularJS UI Bootstrap project.\n-Copyright (c) 2012-2017 the AngularUI Team, https://github.com/organizations/angular-ui/teams/291112]\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the AngularJS UI Router project.\n-Copyright (c) 2013-2015 The AngularUI Team, Karsten Sperling\n+Copyright (c) 2012-2016 the AngularUI Team, https://github.com/organizations/angular-ui/teams/291112]\n \n ==\n \n@@ -25,7 +20,7 @@ Copyright (c) 2013-2014 AngularUI\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Animate.css project.\n-Copyright (c) 2017 Daniel Eden\n+Copyright (c) 2016 Daniel Eden\n \n ==\n \n@@ -39,7 +34,7 @@ Copyright (C) 2011-2015 by Nick Payne nick@kurai.co.uk\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Bootstrap project.\n-Copyright (c) 2011-2017 Twitter, Inc.\n+Copyright (c) 2011-2016 Twitter, Inc.\n \n ==\n \n@@ -49,7 +44,7 @@ Copyright (c) 2013-2015 bootstrap-select]\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Modernizr project.\n-Copyright (C) 2017\n+Copyright (C) 2016\n \n ==\n \n@@ -62,7 +57,7 @@ This product includes software developed by the Java Uuid Generator (JUG) projec\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Google Guava project.\n-Copyright (c) 2017 The Guava Authors.\n+Copyright (c) 2016 The Guava Authors.\n \n ==\n \n@@ -72,7 +67,7 @@ Copyright 2012-2013 Sebastien Briquet\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the JAXB project.\n-Copyright (c) 2013-2017 The JAXB project.\n+Copyright (c) 2013-2016 The JAXB project.\n \n ==\n \n@@ -87,12 +82,12 @@ Copyright (c) 2010-2014 Coda Hale, Yammer.com\n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Swagger project.\n-Copyright 2017 SmartBear Software\n+Copyright 2016 SmartBear Software\n \n ==\n \n This product includes software developed by the Ionicons project.\n-Copyright (c) 2017 Drifty (http://drifty.com/)\n+Copyright (c) 2016 Drifty (http://drifty.com/)\n \n ==\n \n@@ -106,6 +101,11 @@ Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Oracle and/or its affiliates.
