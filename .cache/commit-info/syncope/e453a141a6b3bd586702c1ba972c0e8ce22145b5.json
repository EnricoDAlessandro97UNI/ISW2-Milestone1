If You\n-distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n-different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n-any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n-alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You\n-hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n-Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n-Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\n-You offer.\n-\n-3.6. Larger Works.\n-\n-You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software\n-with other code not governed by the terms of this License\n-and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\n-a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\n-are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n-\n-4. Versions of the License.\n-\n-4.1. New Versions.\n-\n-Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and\n-may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n-from time to time. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n-Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n-right to modify this License.\n-\n-4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n-notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n-distributed or otherwise made available under any\n-subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n-use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n-available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n-License published by the license steward.\n-\n-4.3. Modified Versions.\n-\n-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n-new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n-use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n-the license and remove any references to the name of the\n-license steward (except to note that the license differs\n-from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n-the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n-\n-5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n-\n-COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n-SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n-COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n-ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n-WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n-ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n-DISCLAIMER.\n-\n-6. TERMINATION.\n-\n-6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n-terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n-herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n-becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n-nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n-this License shall survive.\n-\n-6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n-a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n-whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n-alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n-Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n-or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n-Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n-patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n-Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n-and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n-License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n-terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n-of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n-period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n-Participant Software against such Participant either\n-unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n-Participant.\n-\n-6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n-above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n-by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n-(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n-shall survive termination.\n-\n-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n-LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n-STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n-COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n-INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n-LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n-INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n-APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n-NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n-APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n-defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n-computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n-252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n-documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n-1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n-through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n-acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n-This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n-any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n-Government rights in computer software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n-extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n-governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n-contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n-applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n-jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n-relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n-the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n-notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n-party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n-costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n-application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n-International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n-regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n-be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n-You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n-United States export administration regulations (and the export\n-control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n-distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n-\n-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n-\n-As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n-responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n-indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n-and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n-distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n-herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n-of liability.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For google-diff-match-patch (https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-diff-match-patch/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Swagger (http://swagger.io/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Ionicons (http://ionicons.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For slimScroll (http://rocha.la/jQuery-slimScroll):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For javax.annotation-api (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Bean Validation API (http://beanvalidation.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For javax.ws.rs-api (https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Joda Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jQuery (http://jquery.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jquery.cookie (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jQuery++ (http://jquerypp.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jsPlumb (http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Modernizr (https://modernizr.com):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license:\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n-\n-1.

The\n-fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \n-redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n-names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n-however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\n-requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\n-to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n-\n-DEFINITIONS\n-\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\n-Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may\n-include source files, build scripts and documentation.\n-\n-\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\n-copyright statement(s).\n-\n-\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\n-distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n-\n-\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\n-or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\n-Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\n-new environment.\n-\n-\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\n-writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n-\n-PERMISSION & CONDITIONS\n-Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n-a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\n-redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\n-Software, subject to the following conditions:\n-\n-1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\n-in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n-\n-2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\n-redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\n-contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\n-included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n-in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n-binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n-\n-3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n-Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n-Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n-presented to the users.\n-\n-4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n-Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n-Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n-Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n-permission.\n-\n-5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n-must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n-distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to\n-remain under this license does not apply to any document created\n-using the Font Software.\n-\n-TERMINATION\n-This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are\n-not met.\n-\n-DISCLAIMER\n-THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF\n-MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT\n-OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.

If You\n-distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n-different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n-any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n-alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n-notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n-distributed or otherwise made available under any\n-subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software.

Modified Versions.\n-\n-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n-new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n-use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n-the license and remove any references to the name of the\n-license steward (except to note that the license differs\n-from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n-the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n-\n-5.

Provisions which, by their\n-nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n-this License shall survive.\n-\n-6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n-a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n-whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n-alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n-Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n-or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n-Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n-patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n-Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n-and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n-License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n-terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n-of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n-period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n-Participant Software against such Participant either\n-unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n-Participant.\n-\n-6.3.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n-LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n-STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n-COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n-INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n-LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n-INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n-APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n-NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n-APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n-defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n-computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n-252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n-documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n-1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n-through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n-acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n-This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n-any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n-Government rights in computer software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n-extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n-governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n-contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n-applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n-jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n-relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n-the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n-notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n-party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n-costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n-application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n-International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n-regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n-be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n-You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n-United States export administration regulations (and the export\n-control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n-distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n-\n-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n-\n-As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n-responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n-indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n-and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n-distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n-herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n-of liability.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For HikariCP (http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For highlight.js (http://highlightjs.org/):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license:\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n-\n-1.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n-CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n-\n-1. DEFINITIONS\n-\n-\"Contribution\" means:\n-\n-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n-   distributed under this Agreement, and\n-b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n-    i) changes to the Program, and\n-   ii) additions to the Program;\n-\n-   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n-   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n-   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n-   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n-   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n-   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n-   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n-\n-\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n-\n-\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n-combined with the Program.\n-\n-\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n-Agreement.\n-\n-\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n-including all Contributors.\n-\n-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n-     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n-     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n-     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n-     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n-     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n-     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n-     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n-     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n-     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n-     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n-     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n-     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n-     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n-     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n-     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n-     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n-     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n-     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-     before distributing the Program.\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n-     license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n-its own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-  b) its license agreement:\n-      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n-         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n-         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n-         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n-         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n-         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n-         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n-     within the Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n-if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n-if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n-other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n-Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n-product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n-or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n-infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n-a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n-b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n-Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n-negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n-its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n-that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n-warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n-such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n-court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n-Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n-and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n-risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n-or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n-operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n-LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n-OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n-remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n-parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n-necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n-cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n-(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n-under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n-and survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n-time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n-Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n-Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n-Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n-be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n-Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n-Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n-(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n-stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n-licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n-whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n-Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n-any resulting litigation.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Legion of the Bouncy Castle (http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Woodstox (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxHome):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Cryptacular (https://github.com/vt-middleware/cryptacular):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jasypt (http://www.jasypt.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Javassist (https://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For MyBatis (http://www.mybatis.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Open SAML-Java (https://shibboleth.net/products/opensaml-java.html):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Quartz Scheduler (http://quartz-scheduler.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Reflections (https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Simple Logging Facade for Java - SLF4J (http://www.slf4j.org/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Spring Framework (http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Spring Security (http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For SnakeYAML (http://www.snakeyaml.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above."},{"sha":"e4c2652e904af5a6c0a509d40cb6e8c6e3862234","filename":"deb/core/NOTICE","status":"removed","additions":0,"deletions":160,"changes":160,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/24205a82cf743722e1cde64afde060a320951f52/deb%2Fcore%2FNOTICE","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/24205a82cf743722e1cde64afde060a320951f52/deb%2Fcore%2FNOTICE","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/deb%2Fcore%2FNOTICE?ref=24205a82cf743722e1cde64afde060a320951f52","patch":"@@ -1,160 +0,0 @@\n-Apache Syncope\n-Copyright 2012-2019 The Apache Software Foundation\n-\n-This product includes software developed by:\n-The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).\n-\n-The following copyright notice(s) were affixed to portions of this code\n-with which this file is now or was at one time distributed.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the AOP Alliance (Java/J2EE AOP standards).\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the Jackson project.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the Java Uuid Generator (JUG) project.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the Google Guava project.\n-Copyright (c) 2016 The Guava Authors.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the JAXB project.\n-Copyright (c) 2013-2016 The JAXB project.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the HikariCP project.\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes the Javascript syntax highlighter.\n-Copyright (c) 2006, Ivan Sagalaev\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the Metrics project.\n-Copyright (c) 2010-2014 Coda Hale, Yammer.com\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includes software developed by the Swagger project.\n-Copyright 2016 SmartBear Software\n-\n-==\n-\n-This product includs software developed by Oracle.\n-Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Oracle and/or its affiliates.

Distribution Obligations.\n-\n-3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n-\n-Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n-available in Executable form must also be made available in\n-Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n-distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n-include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n-Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n-otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n-such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n-obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n-for software exchange.\n-\n-3.2. Modifications.\n-\n-The Modifications that You create or to which You\n-contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\n-represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\n-original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to\n-grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n-\n-3.3. Required Notices.\n-\n-You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\n-that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\n-You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n-trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\n-any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n-attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n-\n-3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n-\n-You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n-Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n-applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n-rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n-fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n-obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n-However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n-must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n-support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n-Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n-by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n-warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n-\n-3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n-\n-You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\n-Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\n-of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n-different from this License, provided that You are in\n-compliance with the terms of this License and that the\n-license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\n-or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\n-from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n-distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n-different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n-any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n-alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You\n-hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n-Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n-Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\n-You offer.\n-\n-3.6. Larger Works.\n-\n-You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software\n-with other code not governed by the terms of this License\n-and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

New Versions.\n-\n-Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and\n-may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n-from time to time. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n-Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n-right to modify this License.\n-\n-4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n-notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n-distributed or otherwise made available under any\n-subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n-use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n-available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n-License published by the license steward.\n-\n-4.3. Modified Versions.\n-\n-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n-new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n-use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n-the license and remove any references to the name of the\n-license steward (except to note that the license differs\n-from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n-the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n-\n-5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n-\n-COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n-SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n-COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n-ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n-WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n-ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n-DISCLAIMER.\n-\n-6. TERMINATION.\n-\n-6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n-terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n-herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n-becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n-nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n-this License shall survive.\n-\n-6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n-a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n-whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n-alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n-Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n-or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n-Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n-patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n-Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n-and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n-License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n-terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n-of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n-period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n-Participant Software against such Participant either\n-unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n-Participant.\n-\n-6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n-above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n-by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n-(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n-shall survive termination.\n-\n-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n-LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n-STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n-COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n-INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n-LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n-INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n-APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n-NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n-APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n-defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n-computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n-252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n-documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n-1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n-through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n-acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n-This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n-any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n-Government rights in computer software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n-extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n-governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n-contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n-applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n-jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n-relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n-the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n-notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n-party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n-costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n-application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n-International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n-regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n-be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n-You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n-United States export administration regulations (and the export\n-control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n-distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n-\n-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n-\n-As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n-responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n-indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n-and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n-distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n-herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n-of liability.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Ionicons (http://ionicons.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For javax.annotation-api (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Bean Validation API (http://beanvalidation.org/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For javax.ws.rs-api (https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Joda Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jQuery (http://jquery.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jquery.cookie (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For Kendo UI (http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For lodash (https://lodash.com/):\n-This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n-For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license:\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n-\n-1.
