the type of values that can be assigned to each attribute is defined via the <<schema,schema>> matching the `key`\n+value: being schema defined as _plain_, _derived_ and _virtual_, so can be attributes;\n+. associations with <<external-resources,external resources>>, for <<provisioning,provisioning>>.\n+\n+Moreover, users and any objects can be part of groups, or associated to other any objects.\n+\n+[TIP]\n+.Memberships and Relationships\n+====\n+When an user or an any object is assigned to a group, a *_membership_* is defined;
