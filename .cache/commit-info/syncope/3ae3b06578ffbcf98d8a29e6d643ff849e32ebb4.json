If You\n+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n+      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n+      meet the following conditions:\n+\n+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n+\n+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n+          stating that You changed the files; and\n+\n+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n+          the Derivative Works; and\n+\n+      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n+          as modifying the License.\n+\n+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n+      the conditions stated in this License.\n+\n+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n+\n+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n+\n+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n+\n+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n+\n+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n+\n+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n+\n+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n+      replaced with your own identifying information.
