This provisioning feature (disjoint from the resource link mechanisms) is often very useful in case \n-of reclaims.\n-Assign/Unassign::\n-Apache Syncope gives the possibility to create and remove a sort of hard linking between users/roles and resources.\n-This kind of link implies propagation at link creation/deletion time: it is the composition between link/unlink and \n-provision/de-provision operations."},{"sha":"63dc080219c40e54451ec0a4a6befc7fd4c67a37","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/reference-guide/workingwithapachesyncope/adminconsole/extensions.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":1,"changes":2,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Fextensions.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Fextensions.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Fextensions.adoc?ref=5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e","patch":"@@ -16,7 +16,7 @@\n // specific language governing permissions and limitations\n // under the License.\n //\n-\n+[[console-extensions]]\n ===== Extensions\n The extensions tab shows the extensions installed on the given Apache Syncope deployment.\n "},{"sha":"b3d60cdd1000c22bb3d552a26b14dcb366aede33","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/reference-guide/workingwithapachesyncope/adminconsole/realms.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":1,"changes":2,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Frealms.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Frealms.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Frealms.adoc?ref=5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e","patch":"@@ -16,7 +16,7 @@\n // specific language governing permissions and limitations\n // under the License.\n //\n-\n+[[console-realms]]\n ===== Realms\n The realms tab provides the admin with the power to manage users, groups and any objects, for all any types defined.\n "},{"sha":"c32f8f2938cecd92c6db29a1f7d0d4c1cabccb28","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/reference-guide/workingwithapachesyncope/adminconsole/reports.adoc","status":"modified","additions":1,"deletions":1,"changes":2,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Freports.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Freports.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Freference-guide%2Fworkingwithapachesyncope%2Fadminconsole%2Freports.adoc?ref=5c90dd82c8c79679ec2e75f12f8b056ea772704e","patch":"@@ -16,7 +16,7 @@\n // specific language governing permissions and limitations\n // under the License.\n //\n-\n+[[console-reports]]\n ===== Reports\n The reports tab presents the admin with the reports generated from various jobs run on the syncope\n deployment.
