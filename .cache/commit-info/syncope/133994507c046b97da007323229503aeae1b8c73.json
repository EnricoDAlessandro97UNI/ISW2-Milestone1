Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n-      License.
