Distribution Obligations.\n-\n-3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n-\n-Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n-available in Executable form must also be made available in\n-Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n-distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n-include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n-Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n-otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n-such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n-obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n-for software exchange.\n-\n-3.2. Modifications.\n-\n-The Modifications that You create or to which You\n-contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\n-represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\n-original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to\n-grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n-\n-3.3. Required Notices.\n-\n-You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\n-that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\n-You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n-trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\n-any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n-attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n-\n-3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n-\n-You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n-Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n-applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n-rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n-fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n-obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n-However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n-must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n-support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n-Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n-by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n-warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n-\n-3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n-\n-You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\n-Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\n-of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n-different from this License, provided that You are in\n-compliance with the terms of this License and that the\n-license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\n-or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\n-from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n-distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n-different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n-any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n-alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n-notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n-distributed or otherwise made available under any\n-subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n-use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n-available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n-License published by the license steward.\n-\n-4.3. Modified Versions.\n-\n-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n-new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n-use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n-the license and remove any references to the name of the\n-license steward (except to note that the license differs\n-from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n-the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n-\n-5.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n-terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n-herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n-becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n-nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n-this License shall survive.\n-\n-6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n-a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n-whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n-alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n-Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n-or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n-Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n-patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n-Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n-and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n-License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n-terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n-of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n-period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n-Participant Software against such Participant either\n-unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n-Participant.\n-\n-6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n-above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n-by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n-(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n-shall survive termination.\n-\n-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n-LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n-STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n-COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n-INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n-LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n-INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n-APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n-NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n-APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n-defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n-computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n-252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n-documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n-1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n-through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n-acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n-This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n-any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n-Government rights in computer software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n-extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n-governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n-contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n-applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n-jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n-relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n-the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n-notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n-party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n-costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n-application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n-International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n-regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n-be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n-You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n-United States export administration regulations (and the export\n-control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n-distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n-\n-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n-\n-As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n-responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n-indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n-and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n-distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n-herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n-of liability.\n+For JSR-330: Dependency Injection for Java (https://code.google.com/archive/p/atinject/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n ==\n \n@@ -932,11 +671,6 @@ This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For javax.ws.rs-api (https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n-\n-==\n-\n For Joda Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/):\n This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n@@ -977,33 +711,13 @@ This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license:\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n-\n-1.

Public License Fallback.\n+\n+Should any\n+part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or\n+ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be\n+preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\n+extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each\n+affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n+sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional\n+license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\n+in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n+maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty\n+(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or\n+future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\n+purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n+advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The\n+License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\n+applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\n+License for any reason be judged legally invalid or\n+ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n+ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the\n+License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or\n+she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\n+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any\n+associated claims and causes of action with respect to the\n+Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement\n+of Purpose.\n+\n+4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of\n+other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,\n+including without limitation any person's Copyright and\n+Related Rights in the Work.

A Contribution 'originates'\n+   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n+   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n+   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n+   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n+   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n+     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n+     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n+     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n+     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n+     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n+     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n+     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n+     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n+     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n+     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n+     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n+     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n+     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n+     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n+     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n+     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n+     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+     before distributing the Program.\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n+     license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n+its own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+  b) its license agreement:\n+      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n+         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n+         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n+         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n+         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n+         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n+         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n+     within the Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n+if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n+if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n+other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n+Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n+product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n+or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n+infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n+a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n+b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n+Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n+negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n+its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n+that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n+warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n+such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n+court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n+Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n+and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n+risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n+or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n+operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n+LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n+OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n+Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n+any resulting litigation.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus Content Type (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-content-type/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus Language Tags (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-language-tags/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus JOSE-JWT (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For OAuth 2.0 SDK with OpenID Connect extensions (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/oauth-2.0-sdk-with-openid-connect-extensions/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n For JAX-B (http://jaxb.java.net/):\n This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0:\n \n@@ -622,45 +861,65 @@ distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

A Contribution 'originates'\n-   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n-   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n-   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n-   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n-   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n-\n-\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n-\n-\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n-combined with the Program.\n-\n-\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n-Agreement.\n-\n-\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n-including all Contributors.\n-\n-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n-     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n-     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n-     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n-     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n-     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n-     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n-     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n-     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n-     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n-     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n-     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n-     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n-     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n-     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n-     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n-     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n-     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n-     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-     before distributing the Program.\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n-     license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n-its own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-  b) its license agreement:\n-      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n-         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n-         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n-         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n-         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n-         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n-         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n-     within the Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n-if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n-if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n-other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n-Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n-product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n-or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n-infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n-a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n-b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n-Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n-negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n-its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n-that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n-warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n-such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n-court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n-Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n-and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n-risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n-or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n-operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n-LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n-OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+For Netty (https://netty.io/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n-7. GENERAL\n+==\n \n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n-remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n-parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n-necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+For Swagger (http://swagger.io/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n-cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n-(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n-under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+==\n \n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n-and survive.\n+For Jakarta Annotations https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.ca):\n+This is licensed under the EPL 1.0, see above.\n \n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner.

Distribution Obligations.\n-\n-3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n-\n-Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n-available in Executable form must also be made available in\n-Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n-distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n-include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n-Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n-otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n-such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n-obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n-for software exchange.\n-\n-3.2. Modifications.\n-\n-The Modifications that You create or to which You\n-contribute are governed by the terms of this License.

Required Notices.\n-\n-You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\n-that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\n-You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n-trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\n-any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n-attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n-\n-3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n-\n-You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n-Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n-applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n-rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n-fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n-obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n-However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n-must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n-support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n-Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n-by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n-warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n-\n-3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n-\n-You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\n-Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\n-of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n-different from this License, provided that You are in\n-compliance with the terms of this License and that the\n-license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\n-or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\n-from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n-distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n-different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n-any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n-alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n-notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n-distributed or otherwise made available under any\n-subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n-version of the License under which You originally received\n-the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n-use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n-available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n-License published by the license steward.\n-\n-4.3. Modified Versions.\n-\n-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n-new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n-use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n-the license and remove any references to the name of the\n-license steward (except to note that the license differs\n-from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n-the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n-\n-5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n-\n-COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n-SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n-COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n-ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n-WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n-ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n-DISCLAIMER.\n-\n-6. TERMINATION.\n-\n-6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n-terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n-herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n-becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n-nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n-this License shall survive.\n-\n-6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n-a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n-whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n-alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n-Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n-or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n-Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n-patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n-Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n-and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n-License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n-terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n-of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n-period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n-Participant Software against such Participant either\n-unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n-Participant.\n-\n-6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n-above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n-by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n-(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n-shall survive termination.\n-\n-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n-LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n-STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n-COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n-INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n-LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n-INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n-APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n-NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n-APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n-defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n-computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n-252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n-documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n-1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n-through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n-acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n-This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n-any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n-Government rights in computer software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n-extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n-governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n-contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n-applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n-jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n+CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n+   distributed under this Agreement, and\n+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n+    i) changes to the Program, and\n+   ii) additions to the Program;\n+\n+   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n+   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n+   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n+   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n+   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n+   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n+   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n+     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n+     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n+     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n+     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n+     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n+     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n+     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n+     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n+     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n+     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n+     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n+     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n+     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n+     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n+     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n+     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n+     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+     before distributing the Program.\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n+     license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n+its own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+  b) its license agreement:\n+      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n+         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n+         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n+         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n+         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n+         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n+         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n+     within the Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n+if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n+if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n+other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n+Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n+product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n+or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n+infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n+a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n+b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n+Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n+negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n+its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n+that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n+warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n+such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n+court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n+Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n+and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n+risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n+or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n+operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n+LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n+OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n+Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n+any resulting litigation.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Eclipse Project for JAX-RS (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxrs):\n+This is licensed under the EPL 1.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For JSR-330: Dependency Injection for Java (https://code.google.com/archive/p/atinject/):\n This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For javax.ws.rs-api (https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/):\n-This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0, see above.\n+For Bean Validation API (http://beanvalidation.org/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n \n ==\n \n@@ -654,43 +671,33 @@ This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For Kendo UI (http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui):\n-This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+For jQuery++ (http://jquerypp.com/):\n+This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For lodash (https://lodash.com/):\n+For jsPlumb (http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/):\n This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n \n ==\n \n-For StAX2 API (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxStax2):\n-This is licensed under the BSD license:\n+For Modernizr (https://modernizr.com):\n+This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n \n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n+==\n \n-1.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n+CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n+   distributed under this Agreement, and\n+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n+    i) changes to the Program, and\n+   ii) additions to the Program;\n+\n+   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n+   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n+   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n+   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n+   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n+   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n+   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n+     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n+     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n+     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n+     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n+     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n+     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n+     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n+     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n+     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n+     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n+     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n+     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n+     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n+     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n+     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n+     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n+     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+     before distributing the Program.\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n+     license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n+its own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+  b) its license agreement:\n+      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n+         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n+         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n+         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n+         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n+         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n+         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n+     within the Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n+if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n+if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n+other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n+Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n+product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n+or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n+infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n+a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n+b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n+Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n+negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n+its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n+that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n+warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n+such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n+court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n+Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n+and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n+risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n+or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n+operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n+LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n+OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n+Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n+any resulting litigation.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Microsoft OAuth 2.0 User Agent library for Java (https://github.com/Microsoft/oauth2-useragent):\n+This is licensed under the MIT license, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus Content Type (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-content-type/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus Language Tags (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-language-tags/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Nimbus JOSE-JWT (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For OAuth 2.0 SDK with OpenID Connect extensions (https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/oauth-2.0-sdk-with-openid-connect-extensions/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Moshi (https://square.github.io/moshi/1.x):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For OkHttp (https://square.github.io/okhttp/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Okio (https://square.github.io/okio/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/):\n+This is licensed under the AL 2.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Jakarta Mail:\n+This is licensed under the EPL 1.0, see above.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For JAX-B (http://jaxb.java.net/):\n+This is licensed under the CDDL 1.0:\n+\n+COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) Version 1.0\n+\n+1.

Availability of Source Code.\n+\n+Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n+available in Executable form must also be made available in\n+Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n+distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n+include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n+Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n+otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n+such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n+obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n+reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n+for software exchange.\n+\n+3.2. Modifications.\n+\n+The Modifications that You create or to which You\n+contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\n+represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\n+original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to\n+grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n+\n+3.3.

Application of Additional Terms.\n+\n+You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n+Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n+applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n+rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n+fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n+obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n+However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n+behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n+must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n+support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n+Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n+by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n+warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n+\n+3.5.

Each version will be given a\n+distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n+Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n+right to modify this License.\n+\n+4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n+\n+You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n+notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n+distributed or otherwise made available under any\n+subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n+use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n+available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n+License published by the license steward.\n+\n+4.3. Modified Versions.\n+\n+When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n+new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n+use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n+the license and remove any references to the name of the\n+license steward (except to note that the license differs\n+from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n+the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n+\n+5.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n+COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n+WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n+ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n+DISCLAIMER.\n+\n+6. TERMINATION.\n+\n+6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n+terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n+herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n+becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n+nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n+this License shall survive.\n+\n+6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n+declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n+a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n+whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n+alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n+Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n+or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n+Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n+patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n+indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n+Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n+and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n+License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n+terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n+of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n+period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n+Participant Software against such Participant either\n+unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n+Participant.\n+\n+6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n+above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n+by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n+(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n+shall survive termination.\n+\n+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n+\n+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n+(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n+COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n+LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n+LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n+STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n+COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n+INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n+LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n+INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n+APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n+NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n+APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n+\n+The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n+defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n+computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n+252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n+documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n+1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n+through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n+acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n+This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n+any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n+Government rights in computer software under this License.\n+\n+9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n+\n+This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n+extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n+governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n+contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n+applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n+jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n+relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n+the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n+notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n+party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n+costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n+International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n+regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n+be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n+You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n+United States export administration regulations (and the export\n+control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n+distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n+\n+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n+\n+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n+indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n+and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n+distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n+herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n+of liability.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Eclipse Metro (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.metro):\n+This is licensed under the EDL 1.0:\n+\n+Eclipse Distribution License - v 1.0\n+\n+Copyright (c) 2007, Eclipse Foundation, Inc. and its licensors.\n+\n+All rights reserved.\n+\n+Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the\n+following conditions are met:\n+\n+* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n+  disclaimer.\n+* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n+  disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n+* Neither the name of the Eclipse Foundation, Inc. nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote\n+  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n+\n+THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, \n+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE \n+DISCLAIMED.

A Contribution 'originates'\n+   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n+   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n+   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n+   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n+   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n+     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n+     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n+     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n+     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n+     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n+     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n+     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n+     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n+     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n+     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n+     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n+     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n+     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n+     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n+     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n+     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n+     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+     before distributing the Program.\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n+     license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n+its own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+  b) its license agreement:\n+      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n+         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n+         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n+         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n+         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n+         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n+         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n+     within the Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n+if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n+if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n+other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n+Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n+product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n+or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n+infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n+a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n+b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n+Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n+negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n+its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n+that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n+warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n+such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n+court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n+Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n+and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n+risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n+or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n+operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n+LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n+OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n+Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n+\n+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n+after the cause of action arose.

License Grants.\n+\n+2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\n+\n+Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and\n+subject to third party intellectual property claims, the\n+Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,\n+royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n+\n+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than\n+patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,\n+to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,\n+sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or\n+portions thereof), with or without Modifications,\n+and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n+\n+(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,\n+using or selling of Original Software, to make, have\n+made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or\n+otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or\n+portions thereof).\n+\n+(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)\n+are effective on the date Initial Developer first\n+distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software\n+available to a third party under the terms of this\n+License.\n+\n+(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent\n+license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from\n+the Original Software, or (2) for infringements\n+caused by: (i) the modification of the Original\n+Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original\n+Software with other software or devices.\n+\n+2.2. Contributor Grant.\n+\n+Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and\n+subject to third party intellectual property claims, each\n+Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n+non-exclusive license:\n+\n+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than\n+patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to\n+use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense\n+and distribute the Modifications created by such\n+Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an\n+unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as\n+Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n+\n+(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,\n+using, or selling of Modifications made by that\n+Contributor either alone and/or in combination with\n+its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n+combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\n+have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)\n+Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions\n+thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications\n+made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version\n+(or portions of such combination).\n+\n+(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and\n+2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first\n+distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications\n+available to a third party.\n+\n+(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent\n+license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor\n+has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for\n+infringements caused by: (i) third party\n+modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the\n+combination of Modifications made by that Contributor\n+with other software (except as part of the\n+Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under\n+Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the\n+absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n+\n+3. Distribution Obligations.\n+\n+3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n+\n+Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n+available in Executable form must also be made available in\n+Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\n+distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\n+include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n+Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n+otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\n+such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\n+obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\n+reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n+for software exchange.\n+\n+3.2. Modifications.\n+\n+The Modifications that You create or to which You\n+contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\n+represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\n+original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to\n+grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n+\n+3.3. Required Notices.\n+\n+You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\n+that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\n+You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n+trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\n+any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n+attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n+\n+3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n+\n+You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\n+Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\n+applicable version of this License or the recipients'\n+rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\n+fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n+obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n+However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n+behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n+must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n+support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n+Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n+by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n+warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n+\n+3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n+\n+You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\n+Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\n+of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n+different from this License, provided that You are in\n+compliance with the terms of this License and that the\n+license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\n+or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\n+from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n+distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\n+different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\n+any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n+alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You\n+hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n+Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n+Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\n+You offer.\n+\n+3.6. Larger Works.\n+\n+You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software\n+with other code not governed by the terms of this License\n+and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\n+a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\n+are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n+\n+4. Versions of the License.\n+\n+4.1. New Versions.\n+\n+Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and\n+may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n+from time to time. Each version will be given a\n+distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n+Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\n+right to modify this License.\n+\n+4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n+\n+You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\n+notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\n+distributed or otherwise made available under any\n+subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n+make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\n+version of the License under which You originally received\n+the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\n+use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\n+available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n+License published by the license steward.\n+\n+4.3. Modified Versions.\n+\n+When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\n+new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\n+use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\n+the license and remove any references to the name of the\n+license steward (except to note that the license differs\n+from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n+the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n+\n+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n+\n+COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n+INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n+SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\n+COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n+WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n+ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n+DISCLAIMER.\n+\n+6. TERMINATION.\n+\n+6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n+terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\n+herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\n+becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\n+nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n+this License shall survive.\n+\n+6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n+declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n+a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\n+whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\")\n+alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n+Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n+or the Original Software where the Participant is the\n+Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\n+patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n+indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n+Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\n+and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n+License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n+terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\n+of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\n+period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n+Participant Software against such Participant either\n+unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n+Participant.\n+\n+6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\n+above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\n+by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\n+(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\n+shall survive termination.\n+\n+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n+\n+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n+(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n+INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n+COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n+LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n+LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n+STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n+COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n+INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n+LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n+INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n+APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n+NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n+APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n+\n+The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n+defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n+computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. $\n+252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n+documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n+1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n+through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n+acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n+This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\n+any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\n+Government rights in computer software under this License.\n+\n+9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n+\n+This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\n+extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n+governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\n+contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\n+applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n+jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\n+relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\n+the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\n+notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\n+party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\n+costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n+International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n+regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n+be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n+You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\n+United States export administration regulations (and the export\n+control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n+distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n+\n+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n+\n+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n+indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n+and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n+distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n+herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n+of liability.\n+\n+==\n+\n+For Eclipse Metro (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.metro):\n+This is licensed under the EDL 1.0:\n+\n+Eclipse Distribution License - v 1.0\n+\n+Copyright (c) 2007, Eclipse Foundation, Inc. and its licensors.\n+\n+All rights reserved.\n+\n+Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the\n+following conditions are met:\n+\n+* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n+  disclaimer.\n+* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n+  disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n+* Neither the name of the Eclipse Foundation, Inc. nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote\n+  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n+\n+THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, \n+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE \n+DISCLAIMED.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n+CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n+   distributed under this Agreement, and\n+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n+    i) changes to the Program, and\n+   ii) additions to the Program;\n+\n+   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n+   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n+   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n+   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n+   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n+   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n+   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n+combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n+including all Contributors.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n+     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n+     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n+     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n+     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n+     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n+     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n+     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n+     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n+     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n+     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n+     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n+     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n+     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n+     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n+     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n+     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n+     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n+     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n+     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n+     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n+     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+     before distributing the Program.\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n+     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n+     license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n+its own license agreement, provided that:\n+\n+  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n+  b) its license agreement:\n+      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n+         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n+         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n+         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n+         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n+         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n+         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n+     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n+         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n+         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n+\n+When the Program is made available in source code form:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n+     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n+     within the Program.\n+\n+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n+if\n+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n+originator of the Contribution.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n+if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n+Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n+every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n+other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n+Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n+product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n+or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n+infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n+a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n+b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n+Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n+negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n+its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n+that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n+warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n+such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n+court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n+Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n+\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n+and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n+risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n+or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n+operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n+LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n+OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n+remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n+parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n+necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n+under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n+and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n+time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n+Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n+Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n+Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n+be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n+Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n+(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n+stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n+licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n+whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

Affirmer\n+makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public\n+at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\n+successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be\n+subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,\n+or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n+enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by\n+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n+\n+3. Public License Fallback.\n+\n+Should any\n+part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or\n+ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be\n+preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\n+extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each\n+affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n+sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional\n+license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\n+in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n+maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty\n+(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or\n+future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\n+purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n+advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\").

Should any part of the\n+License for any reason be judged legally invalid or\n+ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n+ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the\n+License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or\n+she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\n+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any\n+associated claims and causes of action with respect to the\n+Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement\n+of Purpose.\n+\n+4.

These can be\n-included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n-in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n-binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n-\n-3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n-Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n-Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n-presented to the users.\n-\n-4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n-Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n-Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n-Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n-permission.\n-\n-5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n-must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n-distributed under any other license.
