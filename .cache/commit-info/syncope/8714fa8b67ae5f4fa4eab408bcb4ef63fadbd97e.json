It depends on the assignment, directly or indirectly\n+ (via memberships), of users/roles to external resources.\n+Users and roles can be assigned or linked to an external resource in three different ways: with a soft link, \n+with a hard link, without any link (see below for more details).\n+Each provisioning operation involving a certain user/role will be propagated (if permitted by resource connector \n+instance capabilities) towards each resource linked by the user/role object itself.\n+In general, the provisioning won't occur on a certain external resource if any direct/indirect link exists with \n+that resource.\n+\n+===== Manage external resource provisioning directly\n+Provisioning will occur on a certain external resource every time the operation involves users or roles assigned \n+to that resource.\n+Users and roles can be assigned to an external resource by defining a direct or indirect link between objects.\n+By the way, Apache Syncope empowers the possibility to control the existence of users/roles on external resources \n+giving the possibility to manage remote provisioning directly.\n+In fact, an authorized user (or an internal task - a sync task, for instance) can ask for \n+\n+* *link / unlink* users/roles to/from specific resources (soft link), \n+* *assign / unassign* users/roles to/from specific resources (hard link),\n+* *provision / de-provision* users/roles on/from specific resources (maybe, without any link).\n+\n+link/unlink::\n+Apache Syncope gives the possibility to create and remove a sort of soft linking between users/roles and resources.\n+This kind of link doesn't imply any propagation at link creation/deletion time.\n+Provision/De-Provision::\n+Apache Syncope gives the possibility to directly provision and de-provision users/roles on/from resources, without any \n+link in place. This provisioning feature (disjoint from the resource link mechanisms) is often very useful in case \n+of reclaims.\n+Assign/Unassign::\n+Apache Syncope gives the possibility to create and remove a sort of hard linking between users/roles and resources.\n+This kind of link implies propagation at link creation/deletion time: it is the composition between link/unlink and \n+provision/de-provision operations.\n\\ No newline at end of file"},{"sha":"7bc130fa30acc472a1cd654d5d5723e86db0b01f","filename":"src/main/asciidoc/concepts/provisioning/sync.adoc","status":"added","additions":52,"deletions":0,"changes":52,"blob_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/blob/8714fa8b67ae5f4fa4eab408bcb4ef63fadbd97e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fconcepts%2Fprovisioning%2Fsync.adoc","raw_url":"https://github.com/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/raw/8714fa8b67ae5f4fa4eab408bcb4ef63fadbd97e/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fconcepts%2Fprovisioning%2Fsync.adoc","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EnricoDAlessandro97UNI/syncope/contents/src%2Fmain%2Fasciidoc%2Fconcepts%2Fprovisioning%2Fsync.adoc?ref=8714fa8b67ae5f4fa4eab408bcb4ef63fadbd97e","patch":"@@ -0,0 +1,52 @@\n+//\n+// Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+// or more contributor license agreements.
